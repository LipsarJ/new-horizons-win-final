"I heard that you want to see me. So, what business do you have for me?",
"I'd like offer my services.",
"Are you a captain? What's your name?",
"My name is ",
", captain of the '",
"'.",
"Good, I'll remember your name. Now, tell me what made you come to me.",
"I'd like to talk business with you.",
"Nothing. I'll take my leave, if you'll allow me.",
"You can leave. But don't disappear completely, it's possible I'll have plans for you.",
"As you say, #saddr#.",
"I am all ears. What made you come to me?",
"Business #saddr#.",
"I'm leaving.",
"Then let's talk business.",
"I am here on behalf of those women standing by your entrance.",
"Your mission is a success. The missing children have been returned to their parents",
"I want to talk about a man who finds favor from your grace.",
"Your mission is accomplished, #saddr#.",
"I don't have anything to discuss with you at the moment, #saddr#",
"Yes, I already know that, here is your reward. I hope that in future I will be able to use your services.",
"Any time, #saddr#",
"So, who do you want to discuss.",
"A buccaneer, #sBernardo Gamboa#, #saddr#.",
"",
"",
"Ah. That man?! And what do you want me to say? As far as I know, his reputation is stainless...",
"You would be wrong. From what I know he kidnapped a girl from your town.",
"Ah, ah, ah. Are you sure about that? I don't want to insult him unjustly.",
"If you don't mind, I will investigate this privately. No one will know of your involvement. If he didn't kidnap this girl, your relationship with him will remain intact, if he did, then you would show to everybody how just and powerful you are.",
"Hmmm... That is not unreasonable. Indeed, I don't risk anything in this case. You may find out what's going on. If your mission ends successfully, I'll reward you. But, since this is your initiative, it will be a modest sum.",
"Thank you, #saddr#.",
"Remind me, what were we discussing?",
"We were talking about a kidnapped girl.",
"Ah, yes, I recall. As I understand, she really was kidnapped.",
"Yes. The scoundrel didn't want to give the girl back and was slaughtered by his own men.",
"Well, no pirate - no problem. Here is your reward. You can leave my room now...",
"As you please.",
"Ah, that's what you wanted to discuss...",
"I don't understand why you don't take this more seriously. Isn't it your responsibility to provide for safety of the colony's citizens?",
"Captain, I'll forgive your criticism of me this once. Don't do it again if you want to find favor in this office. \nAs to those women... I can tell that you are a smart #sperson#, so I will tell you something.",
"I am all ears.",
"Two soldiers were found dead today. One of them had a piece of a crimson fabric in his hand. \nSeveral hours before they were discovered, a strange ship was spotted sailing away from the island under full sail.",
"And this halts your investigation?",
"Well... It's obvious the kidnapped children were taken away from the island. Under the circumstances the search isn't worth the money that will be spent on such an expedition. \nMoreover, they could be anywhere. You should understand that Captain. The sea offers many places to hide. \nAnyway, if you are so touched by the grief of those women, I offer you a challenge to find their children. \nI promise that if the search will be successful, I'll show my gratitude to you.",
"All right, I agree, but first I'd like to know where I can find a witness who saw the ship.",
"No, I don't want to spend my time on such nonsense.",
"You accept? Perfect! You can find the witness in the tavern. It was a merchant captain who sighted that ship.",
"Thank you, may I take leave of you now?",
"I wish to serve Holland, your Excellency.",
"Holland is always pleased to accept new captains into her service. ",
"We are",
"n't",
" currently at war with ",
"the ",
"any nation",
". Of course,",
" but",
" Pirates are always to be sunk on sight.",
"I'll make you proud, your Excellency.",
"How am I doing, Sir?",
"You've sunk ",
" French ships, ",
" pirate ships, a total of ",
" ships.",
"Thank you.",
"I hope you have no qurrel with my service, Sir.",
"Indeed not, captain! In fact, it is my pleasure to award you a commision in His Royal Highness's Navy. As an officer you will be rewarded for each ship you sink in the service of Holland.",
"I am honored, your Excellency, and will endeavor to live up to His Royal Highness's trust in me.",
"I'd like to pick up my wages, Sir.",
"Well, you've sunk ",
" French ships, ",
" Pirate ships, ",
" total ships. Your current wages are ",
", so a total of ",
"Thank you sir.",
"Traitorous scum! Sink your countrymen's ships, will you? You are hereby discharged from the military, your name struck from the roll; and I never want to see your face in this town again!",
"...",
" since last time, here's ",
" gold",
"I've heard I'm up for promotion.",
"You are indeed! Excellent work. Your new rank is ",
"Thank you Sir.",
" Spanish ships, ",
" English Ships, and ",
"Oh yes? I have a proposition for you, captain.",
"Indeed?",
"I have learned that you completed the task successfully; my congratulations, captain! Here is your reward.",
"My thanks; It was a pleasure to aid you.",
"You must destroy the ",
" vessel ",
"quest pirate",
" menacing the shipping off ",
". If you sink her, I will reward you the hefty sum of ",
" gold. What say you, captain?",
"You shall not hear of her again, that I promise.",
"I'm afraid I can't help you.",
"I crave forgiveness, your Excellency.",
"I'm interested to learn about #sgov_nation# relations with other nations.",
"I'm looking for a Letter of Marque.",
"Ah, ",
", so good of you to stop by. I'd like to introduce my ",
". She'll come in once we've finished business.",
"I can no longer serve ",
", your Excellency.",
"I'm through serving ",

"Not a chance.",
"Very well.",

" grants you the rank of ",
"You have harmed ",
", and ",
" does not forget his enemies. Leave at once, or the guards will toss you out on your ear!",
"...",
"You have caused ",
" great harm, captain, but ",
" is willing to overlook your past transgressions... for a price: ",
"Very well, Sir. I accept.",
"A pleasure dealing with you, ",
"And you, your Excellency.",
". In addition, you are awarded ",
" acres of land by order of ",
"Are you sure, ",
" will be sorry to lose your service.",
"Yes, I am.",
" does not take kindly to turncoats, ",
"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"Captain, what's the goal of your coming?",
"Excellency, I'm working for the governor of #sisland_Conceicao#. I must give you this letter and know your answer about my Governor's request.",
"Alright, give me the letter.",
".......",
"(A few minutes later) Cartagena? A military action against that well-defended town... It would be too dangerous even if our nations join their efforts.",
"In fact, this operation doesn't have the goal of capturing the town. We know we don't have enough forces for that. The idea would be to do a quick and spectacular action in order to demoralize the Spanish in the Caribbean and maybe around the world.",
"I understand better... Go on.",
"In any case, we would only need a small number of experienced soldiers. Of course, before starting the operation, I'll go there to confirm we have the conditions to make such operation.",
"That seems a more realistic project.",
"May I inform my Governor, you accept to participate in a possible operation.",
"Yes, if you can assure me it won't be a suicidal mission. I won't accept to lose my soldiers in a disastrous operation.",
"I understand. All the precautions will be taken. I'll inform you over the next weeks.",
"Don't worry, I'll choose the best men of my garrison for the operation.",
"Thank you, Excellency. The Governor of #sisland_Conceicao# will be happy to know your answer.",
"Do you also need my help for anything else.",
"For the first phase of my mission in Cartagena, I'd like Captain Elting comes with me. We successfully worked in the past and he could make easier my task.",
"Of course, take him. I don't have any mission for Captain Elting at the moment.",
"Thank you and see you soon, Sir.",
"Yes, kapitein? Why are you here?",
", you are under arrest. The charge is corruption, specifically that you have been taking funds from the public chest and putting them to your own use.",
"Absurd! By what authority do you presume to arrest me?",
"By the authority of this uniform, and failing that, by the authority of this sword. Unless you wish to challenge that authority, you will please show me your account book and cashbox.",
"Very well, but first I shall know your name. When this is over, you can be sure that you will answer for this outrage!",
"I am Kapitein Mart-jan van de Weg, 3rd Foot Company. And now, the accountbook and cashbox, if you please.",
"Very well. They are in that chest over there.",
"Thank you.",
"Oh? You do not look like the sort of person to be arresting anyone, let alone a governor! Soldier! Arrest this #sperson#. We can start with slander, then work our way up to treason.",
"Oops...",
", you are here on charges of impersonating a Dutch army officer, wrongful imprisonment, slander, and removal of public funds by fraudulent means.",
"I don't know anything about any of that, Excellency. I walked into your town intending to conduct lawful business, and was immediately set upon by soldiers and brought here.",
"So you deny it? Then I shall call my first witness. ",
", is this the #sperson# who stole your uniform?",
"Nevertheless, we have established that you did steal the uniform of this soldier. You then evidently decorated it with the insignia of a Kapitein. And now I call my next witness. ",
", is this the #sperson# whom you helped in #spronoun2# outrageous action in this very hall?",
"Alright, I admit it. Yes, it was I who took your money. But ",
" is not to blame. He believed that I was a Kapitein and that he was following orders. He did not get any of the money. I take full responsibility for my actions.",
"Very well. That is to your credit, at least. Nevertheless, in view of the serious nature of your crimes, I sentence you to be imprisoned for fifteen years. Guards! Take the prisoner away.",
"Fifteen years!",
"Ah, ",
", I have received a rather peculiar document concerning you.",
"What sort of document? Why is it peculiar?",
"Apparently no less a person than the Stadtholder himself has read of your deeds. For reasons best known to himself, he apparently found the account amusing.\nLet me see... 'amiable scoundrel'... 'shows how well the uniform of one of my officers is respected'... well, you didn't show much respect for the uniform!\nAnyway, the conclusion is that he has ordered for you to be pardoned.",
"Pardoned? You mean I am to be released?",
"Yes, that is what I mean. Be assured that your surprise at this is no less than my own. Be also assured that should you commit any further crime while in my town, His Excellency will not have time to read about it before I have you hanged. Now, get out of my sight!",
"Thank you, Excellency. And please convey my thanks to the Stadtholder.",
