"What do you have for me, captain?",
"A few goods to sell.",
"Nothing. Goodbye.",
"How can I help you, captain?",
"I want to sell something.",
"You can't. Goodbye.",
"Hm... I'm afraid you're mistaken. Go to the store -- they'll gladly buy what you have.",
"I'm afraid a store can't help me.",
"Thanks for the advice. Goodbye.",
"Is that so?",
"I have something no merchant will buy.",
"Maybe you should finish one piece of business before starting another?",
"I guess you're right.",
"Ah, there you are again! Hope you know what you are doing and are willing to take the risks, because the coastguard ships and soldiers don't always work together. I am just warning you that while you may miss the first, the others can still catch you. My friends will wait for a few days at the place called ",
"Hmh... maybe I can help you. I'll find you a customer. But you must watch out for the coastguards! They do not like people helping poor town folk like us. You should find out about their patrols around the island. ",
"Okay, thanks.",
". Please don't make them wait too long. ",
"Okay, I'm on my way. After all, you have to take risks if you want to get rich.",
" Here is a little something to help you.",
"Let me know when you are ready. ",
"The smugglers' guild has put a ban on you. It seems you have done our cause no good. But if you pay ",
" gold coins we will forget this has happened.",
"Forget it, I will try my luck somewhere else.",
"I'm sorry for what I've done. Here is your money.",
"Thank you. This money will support our cause. Please allow me a moment to note this down so that I do not forget.",
"I was wondering if you may be interested in a certain peculiar substance.",
"I see you've got some opium! ",
"We are certainly interested in opiates. Some of our brethren smuggle them to various clients that are scattered all over the Caribbean.",
"Could I get a list of these clients?",
"Here you go. To help you I've also included a book to explain how this opium smuggling works.",
"Thank you very much.",
"I suggest you try talking to a soldier in this tavern, most of them are gullible drunks and will tell you anything, especially if you grease their palm a bit. If there are no soldiers here, spend some time in the tavern room, or go and do something else and come back to the tavern later, they're bound to show up.",
"I see.",
"Or if any of your officers are feeling brave or foolhardy, you could talk to them and ask them to go and gather info for you. It can be dangerous however, if patrols are heavy. If you got anyone with good fortune, a golden tongue and, if things go south, a strong sword arm and ultimately some smuggling experience, they'll probably have a better chance of finding what you need.",
"Yes, I could do that, couldn't I? Some of them have more courage than common sense and will volunteer for anything.",
"After you have done that, come back and talk to me. You should do that also if you don't find out the times of the coastguard patrols. Then we can discuss what to do next.",
"Okay, I will see what I can find out.",
"Remember, come back and talk to me whatever happens.",
"Yes, yes, I understand.",
"Do you know the effects of this here opium stuff?",
"Our buyers seem to appreciate its effects very much. Some say it helps them see things better. I used it only once and it just made me very sick. You may wish to consult someone with a more thorough knowledge of medicine.",
"Understood. I'm sure I could find such a person if I would want to. Thanks for the help.",
"I'm sorry, this all sounds too risky for me. I'm afraid I have to cancel the deal.",
"Very well then. I shall be back in a minute.",
"Now what was it you were asking before?",
"So it's your ship they are watching eh?",
"Huh, what are you talking about?",
"Those pesky natives, they showed up today and we couldn't figure out what they where after. But now we see they are watching your ship.",
"And why should that bother you?",
"Well it's making our ... uhm ... legitimate business a bit harder. But it might also offer us some opportunities. If you are interested in such opportunities come talk to me in the tavern. But don't wait too long else the chance will have passed.",
"Okay, I will think about it.",
"You said something about opportunities. I'm interested to hear more.",
"Ah! Well you see there is someone we know who is very interested in the native people you'll see around. Especially in the weapons they are carrying. He asked us to provide him with 10 Bows. Normally this would be pretty hard because those natives keep their distance and they don't want to part with their weapons. But now we see them all around town so maybe you can get those weapons from them?",
"That doesn't sound to hard. What's in it for me?",
"This sounds very fishy, I think I'll pass.",
"Okay, we will find someone else to do it...",
"Okay.",
"The collector promised a very good price if you are able to deliver them to him before two months have passed. Once you have gathered them all talk to me again and I will give you information on where to deliver them.",
"Okay, I'll be back before you know it.",
"I've gathered all the weapons required.",
"Wonderful, now take them to ",
" at ",
" on ",
" then the deal is finished. There you will also receive your payment.",
"Thanks, I'm on my way.",
"I've noticed you are having some problems with this Thomas O'Reily guy. I've seen him also dealing with native people. I thought you might be interested in knowing that.",
"O'Reily! Oh really? Take our thanks and this old bottle for your trouble. It's not much but rest assured we will remember your action here. We will handle this with him.",
"Thanks, my pleasure.",
"Patrols have been lax lately, so this should be pretty straightforward. ",
"The coast guard has been patrolling as usual lately, so this should be a routine exchange. ",
"Security has been tight, so be careful. ",
"The island has been crawling with the coast guard's men lately, so be very careful. ",
"Patrols are sparse right now, but still, be on the lookout.",
"Like I said, patrols have been pretty standard so this shouldn't be anything out of the ordinary, but be careful none the less.",
"Remember, patrols have been increasing lately, so be on the lookout.",
"Patrols have been everywhere lately, so be very careful",
"I need to buy passage to ",
".",
"We don't run a passenger service. Go and find a ship's captain somewhere.",
"No honest captain is likely to want to help me.",
"I see. Well, transporting things which aren't supposed to be transported is our business, and I suppose that could extend to people who aren't supposed to be transported either. Are you in trouble where you are going?",
"No, but I am in trouble here.",
"Very well. Then I'll arrange for one of our captains to meet you at ",
" tomorrow night. Don't be late. He won't wait, and you won't get another chance.",
"Thanks for your help.",
"Not so fast. First there's the matter of your fare. ",
" gold, payable in advance, here and now.",
"Very well, here's your money.",
"I don't have that much. But I can pay you double that when we get to where we're going.",
"Double? Alright, we can accept that. Make sure you don't try to wriggle out of paying, though. You won't live to regret it.",
"Don't worry about that. I'll pay alright - after all, I may need to use your services again some day.",
