"Does something seem amiss to you, captain? What are you looking so strangely at? I assure you, your eyes deceive you not - there IS a woman under this soot and leather apron.",
"Well I'll be -- Oh, I mean, a pleasure, madam. Just how did you come to be the village smith, if I may ask?",
"My husband, Tomas #sPickfurt#, was the swordsmith here for many years. When he died, I took up the shop - learned everything from him, I did. Name's #sTomasina#. #sTomasina Pickfurt#, #ssir#. And I assure you, I'm at least as good as ol' Tom was. Give me that sword you carry at your side and you'll see. I charge same as Tom did - dependin' on the amount of work. And it'll take a little more than a day, I'm afraid -- I'm twice as good as old Tomas, but only half as fast.",
"I believe I may have heard of your husband, Mrs. #sPickfurt#. If you indeed did learn your trade from him, I'd be honoured to have you patch up my old blade here.",
"I enjoyed your story, miss, but I'm afraid I won't be needing your services just yet.",
"Captain, I should say I know enough to tell you that ",
" you're showing me ain't worth a damn! Where in blazes did you find that thing, the bottom of the ocean?",
"Why, I wouldn't give an ounce of piss for that lousy ",
" you're holdin'. And you best not try and tell me my old Tom made such a thing.",
"Why, it's a good thing old Tom's passed on already - one look at that dreadful ",
" would be enough to kill him of shame!",
"I sure as the devil didn't make your ",
" there, but that won't stop me from trying to save it - if you don't mind entrusting it to the hands of a woman.",
"I'd not be ashamed to have such a nice ",
" at my side, captain, but old Tom taught me not to settle for 'good enough'. Let's try and do something more, eh? .",
"My old Tom couldn't'a done better himself on that fine ",
". Nor can I improve upon such a thing. But come back if you find a less perfect specimen in need of a woman's touch.",
"I am certain you know exactly what you're doing, madam. So kindly fire this blade up to its top shape and you shall have ",
"Learned your trade from 'old Tom,' did you? I'll believe it when I see this weapon restored to fine shape. Take ",
"Whether the legendary Tomas #sPickfurt# made this blade or not, I'm sure you'll have no trouble simply mending it to a decent quality, for ",
"I'm sure you're a fine 'smith, miss. It's just that I don't need a sword of more than average condition. Here's ",
"Very well. I'll be seeing you, #sTomasina#.",
"To duplicate the skill of Tomas #sPickfurt# isn't cheap, I see. Let me come again when my purse is a little heavier.",
"There! A job to rival the skill of Tomas himself. And you needn't tell everyone a lady repaired your blade - tell them it was the master #sPickfurt#.",
"I thank you, madam. I'll be sure to return soon.",
"Now, are you going to take me seriously or not, captain? Let's see a blade at your side so that I may work on it.",
"Let me see what you have in stock.",
" pieces of gold.",
"I brought with me quite a lot of blades. Would you be able to put them all in a better condition?",
"Do I look like a multi-armed Indian god? I don't waste my time repairing your crew's forks and clubs so they can break them on someone's head again. But my apprentices could help you out.",
"Please have them repair the most damaged blades, so each is at least of average quality. Take these ",
"If they could bring the blades up to good quality, I'd pay you ",
"I hope your apprentices know their trade. I'll only accept fine quality. Here's your ",
"I'm not quite sure what blades you are talking about.",
"Sorry, never mind.",
"What exactly do you want me to do with that rusty antiquity!?!? No blacksmith in the entire Caribbean could repair it, I'm afraid.",
"There's only one quality that's good enough for me - excellent. Take your ",
