"Hey, this is no place for a civilian, ya hear me? Look around, even birds and butterflies have fled from this warzone. Only the rats flourish here.. on corpses! Get out of this killing field as long as you still have all your legs! ",
"What's going on here?",
"And why don't YOU get out of here, behind the townwalls? Wouldn't it be much safer to stay be BEHIND your artillery instead of loitering out here in the firezone?",
"Is there no way out of here?",
"I am a courier of your commander, and I must get an important message through the enemy lines. You are to clear the way for me!",
"Rats? Rats! I'll follow the example of the butterflies before there is another attack. Like that one forming up over there, for example..",
"Haven't you heard that the French besiege us? All our attempts to break out have faltered in the cannonfire from their siegeworks, and their soldiers and franctireurs kill everyone who tries to sneak through their lines. That is.. ALMOST everyone: now and then some brave and lucky courier gets throu... uhh.. UGH! See that French hunting party assembling in their camp? Seems like the frogs think that YOU are another courier..",
"ME? No, that is a misunderstanding! No need to hunt me down, ya hear meee...",
"You'r telling me.. Tell that our commander! In his wisdom he ordered us to skirmish here: keep their scouts and mineurs away from our fortifications, support couriers who try to sneak through the lines, harrass the French siege camp with hit and run attacks.. A.. An attack?? ALARM! The Frogs attack!",
"Umm.. Hit or run, that is now the question...",
"Only a very narrow and dangerous one: you must evade the French patrols and franctireurs. But the worst danger is the French artillery in the field fortifications beside their camp. Have a look at their positions... Damme, what's going on there.. Lots of activity.. An attack?? ALARM! The Frogs attack!",
"Could THAT be the way out of here?",
"Oh, swell, yet another suicidal breakout attempt? SIGH Well, can't be helped, orders are orders. Allright, we'll feint an attack, the Frogs will sure as hell counterattack, a lot of good men will die, and you MIGHT get trough if you exploit the general confusion.",
"Come on, don't gripe, such is life in the army: 99 percent boring waiting and one percent bloody confusion. Let's go then.",
