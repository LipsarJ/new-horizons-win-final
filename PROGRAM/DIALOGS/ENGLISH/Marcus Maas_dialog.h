"Do you have a free bed in this hovel?",
"I don't have any business with you right now. Goodbye.",
"That's true. I hear most everything. What do you want to know?",
"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"I don't have any questions at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"Maybe they have. There are many rumors around.",
"Hurry. I'm a busy man.",
"It's a little too late in the day to find good sailors. They'll all be asleep or passed out by now. Come back in the morning - or you can spend the night here at the tavern.",

"Yes, I forgot. Alright, I'll come back later, when I have fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've done caused too much trouble for my country",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You arrived just in time. A merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You should talk to him. There he is, just coming in to the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody like that at the moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm, then I will wait.",
"Can you help me with something? I'm looking for the British frigate 'Lightning'. She was supposed to call in here.",
"There have hardly been any ships anywhere near here lately due to that storm.",
"I know. Your governor told me.",
"Wait a second! A fisherman saw a ship sinking off the coast during the storm. Perhaps it was the 'Lightning'?",
"I suppose this is the only lead I have. Where could I meet this man?", 
"The storekeeper is a friend of his. Perhaps you can find him there. They like to talk in the shop.",
"Thanks a lot. I'll go and visit the store then.",
"Can you help me with something? I'm looking for the French frigate 'La Foudre'. She was supposed to call in at #sMarigot#.",

"Would you know if #svillain# has been in #sPhilipsburg# recently?",
"No, I don't recall anyone by that name.",
"Has anyone from the '#sship#' been in here, then?",
"Not that I recall, no. Perhaps you could ask around at the port? Maybe someone there has seen either #svillain# or the '#sship#'.",
"Thanks for your time, anyway. Yes, I shall see if anyone at the port can help.",
