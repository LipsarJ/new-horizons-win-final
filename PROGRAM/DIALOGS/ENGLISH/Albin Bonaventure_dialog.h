"Ah, a new face in my tavern! Welcome, dear ",
"!",
"Glad to meet you. My name is ",
".",
"Save your courtesy for someone else. I, ",
", don't need it.",
"You're a true gentleman. A rare thing around here. My name is ",
". What brings you here?",
"If you don't like my smile so much, maybe I'll take it somewhere else. ",
"Strictly business.",
"Well, aren't we impressed with ourselves? I'm only sorry I don't have time to cut you down to size.",
"Business? You find yourself in the finest tavern on our archipelago! Leave that stern look at the door and have a drink!",
"Eh. Your business is your business. Unless I can get you a drink?",
"Quite right. Pour me some of your best wine.",
"I'll have wine, but not the dishwater you sell your regular customers.",
"Alas, I can't spare the time. Goodbye.",
"Drink that poison you pass off on your guests? I value my health too much. Good day!",
"For only one gold you can get the best wine you've ever tried in your life!",
"2 gold, and I'll see what I can do for you.",
"All right, I'm in a gambling mood. But I want more than wine for this gold. I'll need some information, too.",
"Here's your money, but keep your wine. I'd rather you just answered some questions for me.",
"Looks like I can't afford anything from your wine cellar. How about some rum?",
"I'm surprised you have the gall to ask money for that swill. Just bring me some rum!",
"Rum is also 1 gold. You don't have the money, that's not my problem.",
"What, are you still here? You can't afford the 2 gold for rum, either...",
"All right, bring your wine. Then you can answer a couple of questions for me...",
"Damn, it's daylight robbery! Bring the wine and answer my questions.",
"Too bad.",
"I'm certain I'll live another day without your wine.",
"So, what can i do for you?",
"I'd like to talk business with you. Very important business...",
"Do you have a free room? I'd like to stay here for some time.",
"Do you have any rooms left in this fleabag tavern?",
"I need some information about this city.",
"I have a room. How long will you need it?",
"Just 'til morning.",
"I just need a place to rest my eyes until tonight.",
"It'll cost you 5 coins.",
"Here's your money.",
"Well, it appears the luxury of a comfortable bed is out of my grasp at the moment. I'll spend a night in the tavern hall.",
"For what?! This entire building? Forget it. I'll spend the night in the tavern hall.",
"All right, I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold coins.",
"Here's your money.",
"Well, it appears the luxury of a comfortable bed is out of my grasp at the moment. I'll spend a night in the tavern hall.",
"What, is it a king-size room? No, thanks. I'll sit in the tavern hall.",
"All right, I'll think about it.",
"I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.",
"I don't know the city very well. Can you help me?",
"I'm looking to hire a crew.",
"I need to find the local shop.",
"My ship is in need of repair...",
"I am all ears, ",
".",
"What's the gossip here?",
"I need some work. Don't you know any rich boy on this island who is afraid to travel alone?",
"Thanks. I must go now.",
"If there is such a person, he might prefer to avoid attracting attention with so many consorts - as I'd expect you to know.", 
"Yes, I forgot. All right, I'll come back later, when I've got fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you, with all the harm you've done to my country.",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. Do you seriously think that somebody will travel in your company?",
"You are right, everybody is afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You came just in time. One merchant here was searching to sail in company with just the right companions. You'd better talk to him. Here he is, coming into the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody for the moment. Maybe next time.",
"Hmm. Then I will wait.",
"I've got some more questions.",
"Hello, ",
", long time no see. How are you doing?",
"Fine, fine. Mind if I ask you a couple of questions?",
"None of your business. I'll ask the questions.",
"I'm looking to add some sailors to my crew.",
"Just point me to the nastiest rabble looking for work. I need a couple of cutthroats for my ship.",
"Do you have a room for me? I'd like to stay here.",
"Do you have a room free in this pit?",
"You know my rule - you don't order, you don't ask questions.",
"No, I don't like the sound of that, I won't pay.",
"Here's your money.",
"Thanks, you've been a great help.",
"What are you talking about?! I don't have anything to do with it!",
"Too bad. I'll have to look somewhere else.",
"I'm sorry, ",
", but I can't help you anymore. Try the workers in the port.",
"Thanks, I give it a shot.",
"Yes, he actually owes some money. 500 gold.",
"I see. I was just wondering. Good-bye.",
"I want to pay off his debt.",
"I don't see why, ",
", he's not a very good man.",
"Perhaps you're right. I'll take your advice.",
"I like him. Crude, but I'm used to that. I'll pay his debt.",
"Not at all! Always glad to help you.",
"Farewell!",
"Suit yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you. He owes me 500 gold.",
"Yes, well, you may be right. Never mind.",
"Here is your money.",
"Very well. And here is his I.O.U. It's yours to do with as you will.",
"Goodbye!",
"What are you talking about? Everyone's at home. It's the middle of the night. If I were you, I'd wait 'til morning. Maybe you'd like to rent a room?",
"Do you have a free room?",
"No, let's talk about something else.",
"Sorry, captain. I've got nothing for you. Captain ",
"Stop this outrage, at once, or I'll have to call the guards!",
"All right, all right! I'm leaving!",
"Until tomorrow ",
"I want to give free rum to the crewmembers of a ship called the 'Arabella' tonight. It'll be about a hundred men. How much gold do I need to give you to arrange that?",
"For a whole night and that amount of men, I can charge you no less than 1000 gold coins.",
"Very well then. Don't tell them I arranged this for them though. I want to do them a surprise. If they ask, just tell them your daughter is getting married tomorrow and you want to celebrate.",
"Ehm. That's quite a bit. I'll be back.",
"It's as good as done. I wish we had customers like you every day!",
"Don't count on me doing things like this every day. This is a once-in-a-lifetime exception, so savour the moment.",
"Do you know if #svillain# has been here?",
"If #spronoun# has been in #sPointe a Pitre#, #spronoun# has not been in this tavern.",
"Then do you know if the '#sship#' has been in port?",
"Yes. That's one of her crew there. Hey, you! This #sperson# wants to talk to you!",
"Thank you.",
