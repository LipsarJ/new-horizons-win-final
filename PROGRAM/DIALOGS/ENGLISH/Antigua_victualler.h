"Don't waste my and your time, #ssir#, we don't deal with civilians here. The only exception are loyal privateers with a Letter of Marque.",
"Couldn't I prove my loyalty and commitment to the war effort with a.. err.. financial contribution to you.. err.. I mean the Crown's warchest? Let's say.. ",
" Gold? Don't bother with a receipt, I trust that you won't keep single a coin for yourself..(WINK)",
"But I HAVE a Letter of Marque..",
"Hey, don't you know me anymore? I paid you already before..",
"My, my, you seem to be a very busy and important man. What exactly is your job.. err.. duty?",
" Too bad.. Well, looks like I'll have to visit those cutthroats in the outskirts. Farewell, brasshead.",
"I am the Agent-Victualler of the Leeward Islands Naval Station. The Victualling Board of the Navy charged me with keeping the Leeward Islands squadron fully supplied at all times, so I can't spare a single cannonball for civilians like you. The only exception are loyal privateers with a Letter of Marque, cause they in turn supply us with captured stores. Those can get victuals if they pay me.. err.. the Crown for them.",
"You, #ssir#, are nothing but an imposter! Your relation to the Crown is certainly NOT good enough for a Letter of Marque. Master at Arms, arrest this cheat!",
" You are just too well informed about my RELATIONS.. Well, people who know too much must be killed. Maybe your successor will be less nosy..",
"Really? Well, who cares, it's only a scrap of paper anyway. Feel free to buy what our storehouse has in stock. And if you can spare any supplies the fleet will gladly take them. The Victualling Board will remit you the usual market price.",
"In cash, I hope, and not in Government bonds..",
"Ah, I see! Well, then you can obtain stores from our stock at low government rates. And if you can spare any supplies the fleet will gladly take them. The Victualling Board will remit you the usual market price.",
"I flatly deny that, do you hear me, #ssir#? Cause that would have been an irregular procedure. We have never met before! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? (WINK)",
"Oh no, not with me! You just pretend that we haven't met before so that you can extort another bribe...",
"Ah, oh yes, I understand. (WINK) Must have confused you with another officer, small wonder.. those uniforms look all the same to me. A nice day to you, dear Sir.",
" Indiscreet idiots must be silenced.. ALARM!! THIS IS A SABOTEUR! #sGENDERSubj# HAS A BOMB, KILL #sGENDERObj# ON THE SPOT!!!",
" Those naval blockheads will hardly believe a privateer accusing their superior..",
"SHHH!! Dear #ssir#, be more discreet, I beg you! The Victualling Board has already become suspicious of my.. Ah, never mind, but if you don't raise a fuss I'll grant you access to our stores at low government rates. And if you can spare any supplies the fleet will gladly take them. The Victualling Board will remit you the usual market price.",
"Swell! See, with the right arguments one can convince even naval blockheads..",
"#ssir#, are you trying to corrupt an officer of His Royal Majesty's proud Navy? My honour, not with me! Master at Arms, arrest this vile villain!",
" Hundreds of corrupt officials here, and I must meet the only righteous one.. Well, maybe your replacement will be more susceptible. Cause YOU will be sent home soon.. in a leadcoffin filled with rum!",
"Ah, thank you.. err.. in the name of the Crown! Now if that ain't a proof of your loyalty.. Such honest subjects deserve of course the support of every Naval official! You can obtain stores from our stock at low government rates. And if you can spare any supplies the fleet will gladly take them. The Victualling Board will remit you the usual market price.",
"My apologies Captain ",
", I did not recognise you in this light.",
"Not a problem. Can we get down to business?",
"Of course, #ssir#, of course. We were told to expect you.",
"Indeed? And how was that achieved may I ask?",
"A fast frigate called here a day or so ago with a letter about you from Sir Cutler Beckett. By the way, here is a document package that you should return to him",
"He certainly has things well organised I must admit. He always seems to be one step ahead of me!",
"Oh yes! Not a man to be trifled with. But to business, your ship will be loaded at once, we have the list as to what is required. The payment for these goods has already been made. Do you need anything in addition?",
"I am Captain ",
", of the East India Trading Company. Here are my papers.",
"Yes, I could do with some stores.",
"No, I think I am done.",
"Ah! Of course Captain, Good to see you again. Do you want us to load you up with cargo or do you just need stores?",
"Yes, load me with cargo. Quick as you can I'm anxious to put to sea.",
"No sooner said than done, Captain. The jolly boats are leaving now. Will that be all this trip, or do you need something else?",
"Would you like to see what I've got in stock?",
"Sure. Let's have a look.",
"Later. Right now, I need to talk.",
"Some other time.",
"Are we going to make a deal, or do you just want to buy some supplies?",
"I want to sell off some goods.",
"I'd like to buy some gear.",
"Nothing, thanks. Bye!",
"What do you want to talk about?",
"I'm listening.",
"I was asked to deliver some cargo to you.",
"Might you be in need of a captain, sir? I have an excellent ship, and I can deliver any cargo, anywhere you like.",
"I've got no time to talk right now.",
"No, I don't need your services. Not while you're sinking #snation_desc# ships.",
"In that case, goodbye.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything for you at the moment.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"I'm sorry, but your ship is not large enough for you to be able to do the job that I have in mind.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"Oh! I was just going to ask you to do me a favor. Thing is, I need some cargo delivered to ",
", and as soon as possible. If you manage to do it in a month's time, you'll receive ",
" gold when you arrive. Does that sound fair?",
"I definitely like it.",
"I can't accept it.",
"I already told you today that I don't have anything for you.",
"Oh, sorry.",
"You've remembered your assignment a bit too late, don't you think? I'll take the goods anyway, but don't expect to be paid. Pay closer attention next time! Goodbye.",
"Farewell.",
"Oh! I've been waiting for it for a long time. Here is your reward, my good ",
"Always welcome.",
"Welcome, ",
". What can I do for you?",
"I am here to make a purchase for my ship.",
"I am the Agent-Victualler of the Leeward Islands Naval Station. The Victualling Board of the Navy charged me with keeping the Leeward Islands squadron fully supplied at all times. As you are part of that squadron, you are authorised to provision your ship here.",
"Ah, yes. I have been told to expect a delivery of #squantity# cwt of #scargo#. Do you have it?",
"Umm... some of it appears to have been misplaced. Don't worry, I'll replace what was lost and bring it to you!",
