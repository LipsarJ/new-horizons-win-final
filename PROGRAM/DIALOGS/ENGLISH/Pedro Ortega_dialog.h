"Welcome to my store, ",
".",
"I thank you for your courtesy, but I must talk business with you now.",
"Every one of you shopkeepers says the same thing: Welcome, Captain! Bienvenidos! Bienvenue! Willkommen! Is there some school you all attend? While you're wracking your brain for an original answer, I'd like to talk business.",
"Yes, yes, of course. How can I help you?",
"Just show me what you have in stock.",
"Show me what goods you have on offer.",
"I'd like some information.",
"I'm more interested in information than barter.",
"I'm sorry, but I must take my leave of you.",
"I've enjoyed our little chat, but now I must attend to business elsewhere.",
"Have you merchandise to sell, or do you just need a few personal items?",
"I'd like to sell the cargo I've brought.",
"I want to buy a couple of things for myself.",
"We won't trade at all. Goodbye.",
"Certainly, #ssir#. But what exactly do you want?",
"I'm listening.",
"I was asked to deliver some cargo to you.",
"Surely you must have some job you'd like done. I'd be happy to lend you my services for a fee.",
"I can't talk right now.",
"No, I won't be needing your services...at least, not as long as you're sinking #snation_desc# ships.",
"In that case, goodbye.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything for you at the moment.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"I'm sorry, but your ship lacks the capacity to handle the task I have in mind.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"Oh! I was just going to ask you to do me a favor. The thing is, I need a cargo delivered to ",
", and as soon as possible. If you manage to do it in a month's time, you'll receive ",
" gold when you arrive. How do you like this offer?",
"I definitely like it.",
"I can't accept it.",
"I already told you today that I don't have anything for you.",
"Oh, sorry.",
"You've recalled your delivery a bit too late, don't you think? I'll take the goods anyway, but don't expect to be paid. Pay closer attention next time! Goodbye.",
"Farewell.",
"Oh! I've been waiting for it for a long time. Here is your reward, ",
"Always welcome.",
"I'm sorry. I have nothing for you now.",
"That's a pity. Perhaps you'll answer some questions, then.",
"Story of my life. How about some information, then?",
"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Yes, I'm expecting #squantity# cwt of #scargo#. Do you have it?",
"Umm... some of it appears to have been misplaced. Don't worry, I'll replace what was lost and bring it to you!",
