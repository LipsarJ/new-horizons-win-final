"Got a merchant here who AIN'T a cheat?",
"Can anyone on this wretched rock mend my bloody sword?",
"A fellow's got needs... if you catch my drift. Where might they be met?",

"I'd like to know the history of the famous pirate island -- much storied, to be sure.",
"What's to be found on this desolate rock besides your village?",
"No, rather, another topic will do, shall we?",
"Aye, storied she is: a fine 'istory o' blood an' guts. But we freebootin', seafarin' folk -- calls ourselves 'Buccaneer Caribbeans', if it please ye -- take good care o' our own sort, and s'long as ye be flyin' the skull'n'bones, yer a mate of ours.",

"How lovely. I should like to know more, if you'll bear with me.",
"Y'din't hear this from me, matey, but... Quite a purdy mansion, dere is, jes' trew a spot o' jungle yondah. Been nigh empty dese many years, e'en full o' swag as she is, but we all be a'feared t' touch it, 'lessen the rightful ownah come back -- a right fearful one 'e is, we all knows.",
"Oh yeah?",
"You've been unexpectedly, but delightfully, helpful. Could you answer me another one, mate?",
"** shudder ** Doze red-robed devils kilt me bruddah widdout sayin' a word.",
"It was your brother they killed?",
"Aye. Me bruddah got mixed up with dem after he did some favahs fo' de priest at #sRedmond#.",

"Doze devils be bad bad bad, matey. You really goin' aftah dem?",
"There's money in it.",
"Dey kilt me bruthah, #smistah#. Ah hates dem worse den anyting, but Ah wouldn' go lookin' fo' dem fer all de gold in de Caribbean. But if ye be willin' t' die fer gold, matey, den go talk to #sFatherBernard# in the town of #sRedmond#. He not a good man eithah, but he might know where dose devils be.",

"Good. Something else?",
"I'm looking for a young girl...",
"Who isn't?",
"This is a girl that the pirates kidnapped.",
"What pirates?",
"Oh come on, you look like a very observant and clever young man. Maybe you have noticed a tall girl being taken as a hostage to this town?",
"Alright, I did see them bringing a new girl, a brunette, into the Settlement.",
"What happened to her, where can I find her?",
"Guess they sold her.",
"Like a slave? To whom?",
"Use your imagination traveller...",
"Okay mate, I can't spend all day talking to you. (Bad news - that would be the Brothel I guess!!)",
"I don't know nothing.",
"Maybe there is some gold if you have useful information.",
"How much gold are we talking about?",
"Well let's say 40, and that is only if you know anything of value for me.",
"You seem very eager Captain, why not make it 60?",
"Greedy pirate? I'll give you 50 even though it's far too much.",
"It's 30 or nothing, you pathetic little thief!",
"Take your gold then and start talking or I'll...",
"If you know anything - spit it out or I'll hurt you badly!",
"Do I have to repeat it Captain, I don't know what you're talking about!",
"I'm not afraid of you youngster!",
