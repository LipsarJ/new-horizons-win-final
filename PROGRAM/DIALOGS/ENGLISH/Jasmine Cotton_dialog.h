"Pleased to meet you. I am ",
", a free captain of my own fate.",
"My name is ",
". I am the captain and owner of a fine ship.",
"Welcome to my store. You won't find any better. And if you do, be sure to tell me and my husband shall deal with them, ",
".",
"I thank you for your courtesy, but I must talk business with you now.",
"Every one of you shopkeepers says the same thing: Welcome, Captain! Bienvenidos! Bienvenue! Willkommen! Is there some school you all attend? While you're wracking your brain for an original answer, I'd like to talk business.",
"Yes, yes, lets indeed...",
"Just show me what you have in stock.",
"Show me what goods you have on offer.",
"I'd like some information.",
"I'm more interested in information than barter.",
"I'm sorry, but I must take my leave of you.",
"I've enjoyed our little chat, but now I must attend to business elsewhere.",
"Have you some... goods... (wink) to sell, or do you just need a few personal slashing items?",
"I'd like to sell the cargo I've brought.",
"I want to buy a couple of things for myself.",
"We won't trade at all. Goodbye.",
"Certainly, you scurvy #slad#. But what exactly do you want?",
"I'm listening.",
"I was asked to deliver some cargo to you.",
"Surely you must have some job you'd like done. I'd be happy to lend you my services for a fee.",
"I can't talk right now.",
"No, I won't be needing your services... Do you think that because I'm a woman I can't cope on my own?",
"Sorry to have affended you. Jeez, women are dramatic.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything for you at the moment. You're too good of a #slad# to meddle in pirate business.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"I'm sorry, but your ship lacks the capacity to handle the task I have in mind.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"Oh! I was just going to ask you to do me a favor. The thing is, I need a cargo delivered to ",
", and as soon as possible. If you manage to do it in a month's time, you'll receive ",
" gold when you arrive. And if you don't... Well, let's just say that no store owner will ever give you another job. Or will ever be able to! How do you like that offer?",
"I'm not easily frightened, ma'm. I like the sound of a bit of danger in a merchant run.",
"I was only asking for a small cargo to transport for you, not a life-or-death deal. I think I better leave...",
"I already told you today that I don't have anything for you.",
"Oh, sorry.",
"You've recalled your delivery a bit too late, don't you think? I could've gotten scurvy by the time you decided to show up. You're unworthy calling yourself a captain! Goodbye.",
"Farewell.",
"Oh! I've been waiting for it for a long time. Here is yer money. So do you have any thoughts on spending it yet? If not, I've got a suggestion or two...",
"Always welcome.",
"I'm sorry. I just don't feel like helping you right now.",
"That's a pity. Perhaps you'll answer some questions, then.",
"Story of my life. How about some information, then?",
"Get out, ",
", before I call me husband and his drinking mates.",
"Very well, I wouldn't want to disturb his grog party.",
"Aye, #sladlass#. I'm expecting #squantity# cwt of #scargo#. Do you have it?",
"Umm... some of it appears to have been misplaced. Don't worry, I'll replace what was lost and bring it to you!",
