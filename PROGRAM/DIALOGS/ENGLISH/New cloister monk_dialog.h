"Yes? How may I help you?",	//0
"Can I visit the Chapel?",
"I have heard about the Crypt. Is it open for visitors?",
"May I go inside the Cloister?",
"There's supposed to be an ancient Stone circle here. Is that true?",
"I'm searching for a grave. Can you please show me the way to the Graveyard?",
"I want to see the famous Library - Where do I find it?",
"Oh, I'm just looking around.",
"Of course - but remember it's not a museum.",		//8
"Thank you father.",
"No it's not open yet. Maybe in the future. It's reserved for Bartolomeu o Portugues.",		//10
"I see.",
"Yes, please visit the inner yard. The balcony upstairs is also open.",		//12
"Thank you Father.",
"Yes it's true. This place was sacred (in some way) even before the Cloister was built. You'll find it in the far end of the garden.",		//14
"This will be interesting.",
"Sure. Go to the inner yard and from there the green door leads to the Graveyard.",	//16
"Thank you Father, I got it.",
"You'll find the blue Library door in the inner yard.",			//18
"The Library focuses on science and is only open for engineers.",	//19
"I hope you enjoy your visit here then.",	//20
"The liqours produced here are well known all over world. Can I see the Distillery?",	//21
"Of course. You'll find it in the garden near the crypt building. But testing the products is not allowed here...",	//22
"I see. Thank you Father.",		//23
"Huh?",					//24
"Don't you dare take any books from my Library!!",		//25
"(gulp - Is that the Librarian?!) Of course not Sir.",		//26
"Pardon me, but are you by any chance an engineer, Captain?",
"Indeed I am. At your service, Father.",			//28
"Do you know the researcher Sakharine?",			//29
"Yes I do - he's an professional acquaintance of mine.",
"I'm sorry but - ehh can you prove that?",			//31
"What!? In fact I can, I have this letter from Ivan Sakharine. See for yourself.",
"Very good. The inventor asked me to give this Library Map to you in exchange for his Letter.",//33
"Okay... Do I need a Map to find my way in the Library?",
"I think it's a very good idea, Captain.",		//35
"Is that so. What more can you tell me about the Library, Father.",
"If I may give you an advice - there are many valuable books here but please don't try to steal any of them. The Librarian is not to be fooled around with!",//37
"(Hmm that's an idea) Of course not, I'll just look for my friend. (and I'm not really scared of a Librarian!)",		//38
"So... you've taken ALL the valuable books. Remember I warned you!",		//39
"Ehh... (this doesn't feel good at all)",		
"It's quite impressing after all so I'll give you a reward.",		//41
"Okay... (he's not going to kill me?)",
"You can keep all the books.",		//43
"Thank you. (is there a but..?)",
"You are also from now immortal!",		//45
"Is it really true? (this is far beyond anything I could have imagined)",
"Yes, it comes with your new task - or should I say profession.",		//47
"Huh, what can that be? (I have a bad feeling)",
"The only one who's allowed to take all those books is the Librarian.",		//49
"Yes..? (here it comes)",
"Congratulations, you're the new Librarian!",		//51
