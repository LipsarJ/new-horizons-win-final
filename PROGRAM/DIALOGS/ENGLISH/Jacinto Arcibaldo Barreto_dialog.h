"I'd like to talk to you about a small piece of business.",

"What?! The deal was 10 thousand!",
"I can't help you. In the future, try to be more calm.",
"Whatever you say, #saddr#. Dirty swine...",

"I thank you for your infinite kindness, sir.",

"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"Oh yes? Tell me what you want.",
"I've heard you'd like to arrest a pirate.",
"Indeed, how do you know this?",
"A captain at #sRedmond# told me.",
"Are you a Captain?",
"Yes, Governor. My name is Bartolomeu, I came from Portugal a while ago.",
"A compatriot. Have you had some experience in the archipelago?",
"Yes, I've already fought the Spanish at #sSantiago#.",
"Excellent! Our small colony needs captains like you. Because of the war with Spain, everything that weakens the enemy will help us gain independence.",
"Is the pirate working for the Spanish?",
"No. He's English, but I don't know if he works for the British or the Spanish.",
"What did he do, against the colony or against Portugal?",
"He has attacked many Portuguese ships and even has had the audacity to attack farmers outside town.",
"Do you know where I can find this arrogant wretch?",
"I have no idea. We have tried to arrest him many times, he always succeeds in escaping from our fleet. In fact, he's got a fast ship - a new model caravel.",
"This seems to be a hard task... to capture him, I mean.",
"That's why I'll be very generous if you succeed.",
"How generous, exactly?",
"You'll receive 40 000 gold coins and the farmers will supply many goods from our plantations.",
"That's a generous reward indeed, for one Captain!! I'm willing to help you. The only problem is I have no idea to start my search.",
"Well, the last time he was chased by one of my ships, he was escaped to #sisland_Oxbay#.",
"When did this happen?",
"Only one month ago.",
" The trail is still warm, why did your captain not try to capture him there?",
"He couldn't, orders you see. We have an agreement with the British authorities. None of our warships can moor on this island unless they are in distress.",
"So you don't know if this pirate moored at #sisland_Oxbay#, or not?",
"No. However, I sent a diplomat there only days after, but the British were not interested in helping us.",
"Strange, the British protecting a pirate!! Do you think this tells us something?",
"As I told you, I can't confirm if he works for them or not, but indications are that he does. My diplomat could only advise that he didn't see the ship at any of the ports on the island.",
"Just one more question. Did your captain damage the pirate ship or did he just chase him?",
"He succeeded in slightly damaging the caravel. But the pirate still managed to escape. Why do you ask?",
"I'll go to #sisland_Oxbay#. Maybe, I can obtain more information than your diplomat.",
"Alright, captain. Do your best. I'm already impatient for you to find a lead.",
"Thank you, Governor. See you soon!",
"Captain! here you are. Congratulations for the arrest of Charles Baxter. It is his name, isn't it?",
"Yes, Governor. But, that was a perilous mission to capture him.",
"I believe it. Where did you find him?",
"At #sCharlestown#. He was protected by the Governor himself.",
"How can that be! The relations between Portugal and England are friendly. It's unconscionable a British Governor would protect a pirate attacking my colony.",
"He was corrupt and Charles was very generous.",
"I will send a despatch to our King, he will advise the British Crown. Maybe their King will depose the Governor of #sCharlestown#.",
"Indeed, that could be a solution.",
"Anyway, as promised, let's talk of your reward. First, the money, 40 000 gold coins, as promised, and I already gave the order to load some goods onto your ship.",
"Thank you Governor. It has been a pleasure to serve you.",
"That is not all, I want to give you a special item.",
"What is it? I am curious.",
"As gratitude for your courage and valour, let me give you this sword. I used it when I was a young officer in Brazil. It is a bit worn but believe me it's still an excellent sword. You will look the part of a professional swordsman.",
"What a beautiful blade! You honour me with this gift.",
"You are always welcome in our fine colony. You obviously have other plans now, with a full purse and cargo to sell. I'll be happy to greet you again in the future.",
"So I do. Fare thee well, Governor!",
"Yes?",
"Your envoy told me you have a mission for me.",
"Indeed, Captain. But, it’s a sad story I have to tell.",
"Why sad?",
"My brother came from Portugal a year ago. He helped me in the war against the Spaniards commanding the Navy of #sisland_Conceicao#. He won many battles against our enemies but unfortunately he was killed during a boarding by a Spanish Captain a few weeks ago.",
"Please, accept my condolences Governor. But the death of your brother, has it any relation to the mission?",
"Yes, Captain. I want my revenge. I know you have a lot of experience in fighting the Spaniards. I will pay you 50,000 gold coins, if you find and kill his murderer.",
"A great reward. Do you know who has killed your brother?",
"Yes, thanks to a spy, I now know his name. It’s Captain Arturo Campos. He used to patrol around #sTortuga# and San Salvador.",
"So that is the key, I shall sail to those islands in search of him.",
"Indeed. But this time, you will have the help of my Navy.",
"Is it necessary, Governor?",
"The soldiers and sailors who served under my brother voluntarily asked to participate in this mission. My brother was well respected.", 
"How many men will accompany me?",
"In fact, I will lend you a Fragata Latina for the mission. You won’t have to use your ship. Your men can stay here until you accomplish the mission.",
"Hasn't that ship a Captain, already?",
"Yes, Captain Queiroz. He will be your officer during the mission. You can find him outside... Waiting for you.",
"Alright. I need to talk to my officer, Emilio Soares, before leaving the island.",
"That’s understandable. Do as you like, I just want you succeed in killing Arturo Campos.",
"Consider him a dead man walking. See you soon, Governor.",
"Here you are! What happened? Did you find Campos?",
"Yes, Governor. We met him on #sisland_Turks#. He was killed during a fight between your soldiers and the Spaniards.",
"Congratulations Captain! Finally, the death of my brother has been avenged. You don’t know how important it was. Take these 50,000 gold coins as promised.",
"Thank you, Governor.",
"However, I've got a bad news for you. Did you meet your crew before coming here?",
"No. Is there anything wrong with them?",
"When you were accomplishing the mission, your ship was boarded by the enemy.",
"The enemy? Who dared to attack my ship?!",
"A mercenary working for the Spaniards according to your crew. He secretly boarded your ship at night with his men. So quietly did they attack, the soldiers of the fort protecting the port didn’t even notice.",
"But he didn’t steal my ship, I saw her moored in the port today.",
"He was not interested in stealing your ship, he was only looking for you.",
"Humm.. Another Spanish mercenary wanting to earn a substantial reward for my capture, ha ha, fat chance they have.",
"I believe it was the Spanish.",
"Forget him, Governor. He will look for a long time before he can find me.",
"But, you do not understand, when they left your ship they took your officer, Emilio Soares.",
"Son of a Monkey's bum! He will pay dearly for this, just as Pedro Rivera did, but not as quick. Now, this changes everything. I will not leave Emilio in the hands of his captor. I will find him.",
"If you would like some help, you only have to ask. Do you need a ship or some soldiers to aid in your search?",
"No, Governor. I only need to know the name of the mercenary. Does my crew know it?",
"I asked but they don’t know.",
"Without his name, the search will be harder.",
"Maybe I can help you. There is a Spaniard who works for me as an informer. Thanks to him, I discovered that it was Campos who killed my brother.",
"Interesting. Where can I find him?",
"The informer lives on #sIsla Muelle#. Take this letter which explains that you work for me. Otherwise, he will treat you as an enemy.",
"Thank you, Governor. I must leave #sConceicao# and find my officer - the sooner, the better.",
"Of course, Captain, be careful, you will be on enemy soil. Good luck and fair winds.",
"Goodbye, Excellency.",
"Captain Bartolomeu! A long time I didn't meet you. It's always a pleasure to see you back.",
"Thank you, Governor. Unfortunately, I've had some trouble recently. I would like to know if you could help me.",
"Of course. But, what happened?",
"My crew mutinied due to the behaviour of an officer. They captured my ship, marooned me, attacked an English warship and sank off Jamaica.",
"Sad news, indeed.",
"I need to earn quickly enough money. Maybe, you could give me a mission as you did in the past.",
"In fact, Captain, you came at the right moment. I've got a very important mission.",
"What is it exactly?",
"Let me explain. Two weeks ago a small Portuguese fleet captured off #sisland_Isla Muelle# a Spanish warship coming from Spain.",
"So?",
"Aboard, there was an envoy of the King who had to go to Cartagena for a mission. He had with him a letter from the King himself. His mission was to check the town defences recently improved and know the real situation of Cartagena in many aspects.",
"Where is he?",
"In the jail with the warship's crew.",
"What help do you want to?",
"I would like you go to Cartagena being taken for the envoy. The idea is to make some intelligence service first. I want to know if a small group of soldiers can make a spectacular operation to hit the Spanish moral in the region but also to boost the Portuguese one in Europe in the war against the Spanish.",
"Well, I like that. Must I go right now to Cartagena?",
"Not yet. As you know, our relations with Holland are friendly. Both countries have the same enemy: Spain. I think it would be interesting if I could encourage the Dutch to participate in a future operation.",
"I could be useful for that. I know a Dutch captain living in Bonaire. He could obtain the help of his Governor.",
"Excellent! I'm going to write a letter explaining my intentions. You'll give it to the Governor after talking to your friend.",
"I'll do.",
"Come back here as soon as you have an answer.",
"Certainly, Governor. I'll be in the port waiting for the letter.",
"Here you are, Captain Bartolomeu! Have you got any good news?",
"Yes, Excellency. The Dutch Governor agreed to help us in a military operation.",
"Great! Now, you can start your mission. As I said in our last talk, I want you go to Cartagena being taken for the envoy. So, you'll use his ship we captured during the arrest.",
"Where is she?",
"In the port at the moment. We had to repair her these last days but now she's in perfect conditions. I've also supplied her with a new crew to substitute the Spanish one. Part of the crew is composed of soldiers will participate in a possible military operation.",
"Who's their Captain?",
"You know him. It's Augusto Queiroz.",
"Of course, I remember. He helped me when I've had to kill the Spanish Captain Arturo Campos in the Turks island.",
"Exact. He and his soldiers will stay hidden in the ship until you start the military operation. Remember Captain! you'll only start the operation after I accept it. I don't want any personal initiatives without my agreement. Do you understand?",
"Yes, Excellency. I'll send someone here to have your agreement about the details of the attack I want to lead.",
"Good. Before leaving #sisland_Conceicao#, take this letter written by the Spanish King which the envoy had. You'll give it to the Governor of Cartagena. Remember, your name now is Guillermo de la Rosa.",
"I won't forget. Goodbye Excellency!",
"Ha! Captain. I'm so happy to see you again and Captain Queiroz already explained the mission has been a success. No doubt, I'm proud of you!",
"Thank you, Excellency. The Cartagena's fort was partially damaged. The Spanish will need many weeks to have the fort operational again.",
"Wonderful, I must say. It's a hard hit in their confidence. So, how could I reward you for that? I know... I give you some land in #sisland_Conceicao#. Thus, you'll regularly earn some gold from the cultivation of them.",
"Thank you again Governor for your generosity. You always helped me when I needed.",
"And you deserve anyway. In Portugal, people already know about your exploits in the Caribbean. Even our King knows as you fight the Spanish. It wouldn't be surprising that one day the King invites you to visit him in Lisbon.",
"It would be a pleasure to return to my country one day.",
"Indeed. Well, I know you have more to do now in my town so have a good day, Captain Bartolomeu.",
"You too, Governor.",
"That’s understandable. Do as you like, I just want you to succeed in killing Arturo Campos. And seeing you are working for me now, you should take this Letter of Marque to legalize your actions on my behalf.",
