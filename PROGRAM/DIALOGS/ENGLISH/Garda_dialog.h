"What do you think you're doing aboard our ship?",
"That is not the thing you should be worrying about. It's your LIFE you should be worrying about! If you want to remain on this side of the dark curtain of death, surrender now. And that includes the surrender of your companions.",
"Hah! Don't make me laugh. We are with much more than you. ALERT! WE ARE ATTACKED!",
"Always the same with the simple minds. Never know when to give up.",
