"Of course. Here they are. <make a play of looking in your pocket> Ah. Hopefully they're still in the barracks, otherwise a pickpocket has helped himself to them and I'll need to get the papers replaced. I'll return when I have them.",
"Here are the papers.",
"Thank you. Yes, these are valid papers for a Kapitein who has just been commissioned into the 3rd Foot Company. I have the required insignia in stock. Come back tomorrow and I'll have the uniform ready for you.",
"Thank you.",
"I am here to ask about the uniform I ordered.",
"Yes, I've been waiting for you. The uniform is now ready. That will be 4000 gold, please.",
