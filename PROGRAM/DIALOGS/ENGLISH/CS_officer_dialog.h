"Go away, #ssir#! Can't you see I'm trying to enjoy my drink?",
"Alright, don't be like that. I'll leave you in peace.",
"May I share your table? I'll pay for your next drink.",
"Well, as long as you're paying, you are welcome to join me.",
"Bartender! Two more mugs of rum!",
"I must say, you are more generous than the other people here.",
"Thank you. Hey, I heard the silver train is on its way here.",
"<To a nearby soldier>Hey, you! Go and invite the rest of the squad to join us! <To you> So you're interested in the silver train, are you?",
"Yes. It ought to be something to see when it arrives!",
"Not particularly. But nothing much else happens round here. Anyway, I'd better be going.",
"Oh, you can be sure it will arrive. Do you know anyone else who is interested in watching it?",
"Probably half the people in town. It's not something they see every day!",
"No. And something else they don't see every day is someone being arrested for taking too much interest in the silver train. But they're going to see that now!",
"They don't often see someone resisting arrest either, and that's what they're about to see!",
