"Enough of your moaning! My name is ",
". I assume you've heard of me.",
"Oh, it's you again, with your problems...cough-cough!",
"You may not have your health, but your memory is fine. Now let's get down to business.",
"That's right, it's me again, and you're as tiresome as ever. Let's just talk business.",
"Sorry to bother you. I should go.",
"You know, I've heard enough of your complaints about life. Goodbye.",
"You young people are so disrespectful these days! You've got passion and strength, what else do you need?",
"You must've been young once, yourself. Have a little patience.",
"Yes, and I guess your youth passed away so long ago, you can't even remember it.",
"Show some respect for your elders, cub!",
"Please don't raise your voice to me again. Can we just get down to business?",
"Watch your shriveled tongue, old man, or I'll put you out of your misery! If you're smart, you'll close your mouth and think about business.",

"I need to repair my ship - although I might consider just scrapping it and buying a new one.",
"I need to install new guns on my ship.",
"Nothing, thanks.",
"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Allright, my dock beside the fort is available for you. If you want I'll tell my dockmaster to tow your ship in there. Only then can I survey the damage and tell you how much time and money it'll take.",
"DOCK BESIDE THE FORT?? Uhh... I just remember that I have... eeh... another pressing business I must attend to first. Goodbye.",
