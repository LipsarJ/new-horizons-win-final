"Congratulations, you actually managed to redeem all those poor souls trapped in THIS location. Now I can rest in peace as well. Fame and knowledge shall be your reward. But be aware, the EVIL is always and everywhere, so you may soon have to fight again. ",
"That's fine for me, the more fights the more loo.. err.. honour. Farewell and bon voyage, whereever you go now. ",
"YOU... ME... NO... KILL",
" Well, you may be persistent, but dumb and slow as well. I can easily kill you another dozen times.. and I bet you don't have THAT many lives.. err.. deaths..",
"Ah, never mind, I'll just keep on killing you till we both get our reward: I my well deserved treasure and you your well deserved death. Who knows, maybe you'll the happier one..",
"But you loose some bones every time you reassemble your err.. remains. And how are you going to fight without arms? Spit your loose teeth?",
"Why couldn't you leave me alone..",
"Hey, aren't you happy that I redeemed you from that miserable undead existence? Your soul is freed of your cursed body now!",
"Thank you, my saviour, thank you so much for redeeming my soul from that miserable undead existence..",
"Yes, yes, I've heard that story already! Just gimme my reward and go to hell.. er.. heaven.",
"Bah, words! I'd prefer it if you'd thank me with loot. And get lost afterwards.",
"Spare me your sermon and give me your sword. And then off to Hades where you belong..",
"Enlighten me, please, is this weird place supposed to be the crypt of your abbey? ",
" You live? I must say, you're rather tough, I thought I had killed you. TWICE even! ",
"Thou shalt rest in peace henceforth! God bless you on your last voyage. And take your possessions with you, I don't want any treasure that has seen so much evil! ",
"Well, we use these venerable vaults as crypt, or rather, we used them when we were still living here.. Actually this is the basement of an ancient Akellani temple. \nOr rather, was. When the first Christian missionaries arrived here they redeemed the Akellanis from their pagan beliefs by erasing their leadership, culture, two thirds of the population.. \nAND the temple. On its foundations they built the Abbey to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity.","You're telling me! And what are those strange.. err.. eruptions? ",
"Righteous Christian killers, souls trapped in undead monstermonks, pagan priests... That's just too much for me! I'll simply kill and plund.. err.. redeem everyone -and everyTHING- I encounter. And now off with you to Hades where you belong..",
"Nobody knows for sure. They burst out of the ground after a volcanic eruption nearby opened up cracks in the floor. Scientific minds claim that this are simply volcanic gases, but the closer you get the more it feels like outbursts from hell. \nThough apart from those.. err.. eruptions there are a few cracks emitting a vapour that increases your strength and longterm health, but there are certain side effects.",
"So I'd better get some antidotes, eh? Umm.. you mentioned some ancient graves.. with artefacts.. and maybe treasure? Not that I'd care for treasures, mind you, I just ask out of scientific curiosity.. ",
"Righteous Christian killers, souls trapped in undead monstermonks, pagan priests, magic springs... That's just too much for me! I'll simply kill and plund.. err.. redeem everyone -and everyTHING- I encounter. And now off with you to Hades where you belong..",
"Of course! Well, you are not the first 'scientist' venturing here. Most of your predecessors are studying those ancient graves from inside now.. FOREVER! \nBut maybe you are the chosen one that will succeed in purging ALL evil from this cursed place, so I'll tell you all I know: there are seven burial places, deliberately unmarked to hide them from.. err.. scientists. \nBut you can find them by searching the ground for disturbances caused by digging. Those burial places have been used for centuries, so the deeper you dig the more you'll find.. tough some findings may be rather unpleasant! \nAnd seven grandmasters of our order have buried their treasurechests down here. Feel free to take anything you can find, and here, take my possessions as well. We don't need those vain things where we now go, wherever that may be. \nI pray it will be Heaven, cause I have endured my share of purgatory already! God blessssss........... ",
"Hey, please stay! There are still so many questions, so many mysteries... ",
"Umm, well.. I AM dead. And I was dead, sort of, even before we met. I think I owe you an explanation, eh? Only.. I can't really explain what happened either, it's a mystery to me as well. \nA terrible mystery! It all started years ago when the Inquisitor of our abbey accused one of our kitchenslaves of being a witch. She was a beautiful young girl, freshly imported from the Ebony coast, and probably she had only practised some African rituals secretly. ",
"Oh, yes, many slaves cling to their pagan beliefs. They give them the inner strength to endure the daily humilation of slavery. And some try to get even with their white tormentors by means of spells and curses. It may even work.. if the target beliefs in such nonsense as well. ",
"Superstitious rubbish! Reason tells me that you are dead, so would you be so kind to decease and yield the loot?",
"Nonsense, eh? Our Inquisitor took it rather serious. DEADLY serious. Serious enough to condemn a thirteen year old girl to the pyre. And maybe he was right, cause that cute child was stronger than all the monks and knights and grandmasters of our order together\nThough she didn't look THAT dangerous on the day of her execution. She couldn't even crawl cause the Inquisition's rack had torn her slender joints apart, and I assume our jailers had played their private sadistic games with her as well\nBut when the first flames reached her she suddenly was transformed. As if the fire wouldn't hurt but revive her. As if the flames were not her enemies but her friends.. or subjects even\nShe uttered no sound at all but reared herself up in a proud, almost regal posture, and stared at us with eyes that shone like fire, brighter than the pyre itself. The weird thing was that EACH of the thirty monks and knights who witnessed her death was later convinced that she had stared at him only all the time.", 
"Go on.",
"We were unable to avert our eyes from hers until flames and smoke engulfed her. And.. when the smoke cleared there was no sign of her anymore, not even the smallest toth or bone remained of her.. Well, a few days later all those who had stared into those fiery eyes started to.. change\nNothing aroused our interest anymore, we quit first work, then worship and talk, and later even food and drink. And thinking as well, our brains were filled with a terrible, desperate black void, worse than hellfire in the long run\nOur whole days -and nights- were spent shuffling aimlessly through the silent rooms of our once so rich and lively abbey, stammering words now and then that we couldn't understand ourselves anymore, phrases that sometimes surfaced from the deep black void in our heads. Like bubbles in a poisoned swamp. Echoes from the past. Few other people dared to enter the abbey anymore, and we took notice of those only when we actually ran into them.",
"Keep on going.",
"And then a mad envoius rage at those who still had life in their hearts and minds overcame us and.. we.. tore them apart, yes, no other words can describe those slaughters\nThat mad, bloody rage was actually the only sign of life that we ever showed, otherwise we were dead souls in living bodies.",
"That reminds me, a mulatto girl I once.. er.. knew told me of such undead victims of Voodoo sorcery. Sumbees she called them, and scared to death she was of them. Well, my company at night redeemed her of her fears. ",
"Looks like you are a chosen redeemer, by sword or by.. err.. company. You turned me from a dead soul in a living body into a living soul freed of its dead body. Quite a change for the better, I can tell you. \nWell, Redeemer, who knows, maybe the reason for my apparition before you is that Heaven wants to give me the opportunity for a last appeal to you: try to redeem all those poor souls trapped in the crypt ",
". Heaven will surely reward you for that, and if you care more for earthly rewards you can take the weapons and jewels of the knights who are forced to haunt the crypt. And seven grandmasters of our order have buried their treasurechests down there. \nFeel free to take anything you can find, and here, take my possessions as well. We don't need those vain things where we now go, wherever that may be. I pray it will be Heaven, cause I have endured my share of purgatory already! God blessssss........... ",
"Hey, please stay! There are still so many questions, so many mysteries... ",
"Oh, swell! My soul is now free to go to hell, cause that's my destiny after all the thieving I've done in my lifetime. Not to mention the slaughters I committed in my afterlife.. Small consolation that I'll take thousands of Dubloons with me, that won't mollify the devils or cool the hellfire.",
"Thousands of Dubloons???",
"Hehe, have I got your attention? Yes, thousands! You see, I was a very skillfull thief in my first life, before I became a clumsy undead moron. Let's see if my skills have returned with my awareness. \nWell, these bony fingers slip under your coat quite swiftly.. See, got ya purse faster than you can blink. Harhar, my last joke on this world! Goodbye, see ya in hell!",
"I won't let you get away with that much gold! Stay and fight like a man.. err ghost! STAY I SAY... ",
"You see, sword, fire and the pickaxe convert a pagan people much faster than preaching. Though it wasn't such a good idea to use the temple's vaults as burial place for our dead brethren. We used to dig up a lot of Akellani graves, and those contained not only precious artefacts but sometimes also the mummies of priests.. very lively mummies! \nThe old gods still hold the power over this place, and that keeps many of those buried here from resting in peace. So it's very dangerous for LIVING souls down here. From time to time the Order sends some grandmaster or a file of daring knights to purge this place, which they try by slashing everyone -and everyTHING- to pieces. \nBut undead creatures can be very persistent, and some are so dangerous that even the greatest hero can only run away from them.",
