". Who are you?",
"My name is ",
".",
"Well, ",
", I have a proposition for you, if you're interested. The sort of proposition that could make us both very rich.",
"Propositions which can make one very rich quickly also tend to make one dead very quickly.",
"Aye, there's certainly some risk involved. What I have in mind is not for the faint of heart. So if your spine is made of seaweed, you may as well walk away now.",
"I don't mind taking risks for money, provided I know what sort of risks and how much money.",
"Sounds too dangerous for me. Goodbye!",
"Well, ",
", have you found the courage to hear what I have to offer?",
"I'm interested to know how rich you intend to make us, and what are the chances we end up dead instead.",
"No, I'm still not interested.",
"Alright. Perhaps you've heard of the Spanish silver train? All the silver they've gathered from their South American colonies, in one place?\nWell, I can help you get your hands on that silver, on condition that I join you as an officer and take a share of the loot.",
"The silver train will certainly be well guarded and I doubt I'd be able to take it. But thank you for telling me anyway.",
"I'd rather not make an enemy of Spain by trying to attack their silver train.",
"Perhaps I forgot to tell you, but I hold the position of ",
" with Spain. You should be more careful to whom you tell your plans!",
"What size share do you have in mind?",
"50 percent, of course.",
"For just telling me about it? You'll be just one officer among my crew. You can have 10 percent.",
"I might just be one officer, but I'm the one who knows where the silver train is going. ",
"50 percent",
"40 percent",
" or I'll find someone else.",
"Alright, 50 percent it is.",
"You might know where it's going but you'll still only be a small part of the attack. ",
"25 percent",
"20 percent",
" or you can look for someone else, and I'll look for another way to find the silver train.",
"Alright, you have the makings of a fine haggler, and I'm beginning to like you, so my final demand is ",
"35 percent",
"30 percent",
"25 percent",
". Any less and it's not worth my time.",
"No deal. Goodbye.",
"Agreed.",
" And you're hired. Now, tell me where we're going.",
"The silver train is heading for #sCartagena#. The fleet which will take the silver to Spain is heading there right now.",
"How do you know?",
"Because my ship happened to be in the fleet's way. It was sunk and I was captured. I overheard some of the crew talking about it.\nWhen the fleet was passing #sisland_Conceicao#, I managed to escape and swim ashore, then ended up here.",
"So the fleet is already on its way to meet the silver train? Then we'd better get moving!",
"Well? When are we going after the silver train?",
"Be patient. We are on our way.",
"Now we're here, where are we going to hit the silver train?",
"When I've found out exactly where it is.",
"Don't tell me we've come all this way for nothing!",
"It does seem that way.",
"I should never have trusted you! This is what happens to anyone who betrays me!",
"They get to kill you? It can't have happened before, and it won't happen again!",
", I'd like to take part in this expedition. Partly to make sure I take my share of the silver, and partly to do my share of taking it.",
"Fair enough. I like an officer who knows his duty.",
"Fine by me. If you get yourself killed, you won't be needing a share of the silver.",
"I'll be taking my share of the silver now. ",
" percent was what we agreed.",
"Very well. We got ",
" cwt of silver, so you get ",
" cwt.",
"No, I think I'll be taking the whole lot. Thanks for your help, ",
". Goodbye!",
"Thanks, ",
"! Perhaps you'd allow me to continue to serve as your officer?",
"Yes, you've proven your worth.",
"No, you have your share of the silver, and now it's best if we go our separate ways.",
"We got the silver!",
"Yes, now let's get it back to our ship.",
