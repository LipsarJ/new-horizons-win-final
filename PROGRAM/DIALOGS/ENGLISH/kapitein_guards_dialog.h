"Don't try to play innocent with me, ",
"! We know all about your scheme to sell fake government bonds.",
"That may be so, officer, but I had nothing to do with any such scheme. I truly believed ",

"Then I am indeed lucky that you caught him. Good day, officer.",
"I might even believe that if you weren't trying to leave by the landward gate. But if your ship is moored at a beach somewhere then it's suspect - a pirate or smuggler perhaps? Or an enemy spy?",
"I tell you, I'm a law-abiding sea captain. Here's the money ",
" gave me as a fare.",
"You wouldn't be trying to bribe me, would you? If so, that will be added to your charges.",
"Not at all! It's evidence - as I said, it's the fare ",
" paid me. Of course... what you do with that evidence is up to you.",
"Oh, well that's different, then. You're co-operating with our investigation. The evidence will be most useful. And since you've been so co-operative, there's no reason to suspect you of wrong-doing, so you may go.",
"Thanks, officer. Goodbye.",
"Any orders, sir?",
"Just follow me, soldier. You'll get your orders soon enough.",
"Where are we going, sir?",
"To the town hall. What's your name, soldier?",

", sir.",
"It's your lucky day. You are going to help me arrest the governor, korporaal ",

"I hope we don't get into trouble for this. I mean, arresting the governor, sir!",
"We're not the ones in trouble, korporaal. We're the ones doing the arresting. Now, are you up for it, or should I find a braver soldier?",
"No, sir! If you're going to arrest the governor, I want to be there to see his face, sir!",
"Good man. Now, follow me.",
"Korporaal, you will please witness this. I am about to confiscate the account book and cashbox as evidence.",
"Yes, sir. I shall bear witness to you collecting the evidence.",
"Alright. Now, korporaal, I shall leave to collect more soldiers to secure this building properly and to escort the governor to the barracks. Meanwhile, you are to keep guard on this door. Nobody is to leave without my permission.",

"Can I see your commissioning papers? Otherwise it could be you who is impersonating a Dutch army officer.",
"Every soldier here knows very well who I am - Kapitein ",
". And if you give me any more trouble, you'll be shot right here.",
"Very well, I'll come quietly.",
"That wasn't trouble. This is trouble!",
"Yes, Excellency. This #sperson# claimed to be a friend while I was off duty in a tavern, then lured me to a room and forced me to get drunk. Then #spronoun# stole my uniform.",
"Not true. There was no forcing involved.",
"Yes, Excellency...",
"Get up, you! His Excellency, ",
" wants to see you.",
"Tell him he can come here. I'm not going anywhere for a few years.",
"Cease your insolence! You can walk or be dragged, and that is all the choice you have.",
"Alright, I'll go. I could do with some exercise anyway.",
