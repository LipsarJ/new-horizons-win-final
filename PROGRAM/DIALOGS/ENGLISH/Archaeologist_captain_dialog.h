"Fancy seeing you here, captain!",
"Small world, isn't it?",
"Hello! I am ",
". You have something I want - an amber crystal skull, to be precise. Hand it over, please.",
"I am ",
" and this is ",
". We just killed a gang, presumably yours. So why would we give you the skull now?",
"Because I have a cannon outside. The crew have orders that if I don't come out, unharmed, carrying the amber skull, they are to bring this cave down on your heads. We will then excavate the cave and take the skull from your mangled bodies.",
"And we're supposed to take your word that you have a cannon?",
"You're competent fighters. As you said, you defeated my search party. Would I be here alone if I did not have such insurance?",
"Alright, say we believe you. How do we know you won't fire anyway as soon as you're out of the cave?",
"Money, dear #sperson#. Cannon shots are not cheap.\nBesides, there's a lot of unused land through there. If the #snationdesc# authorities don't want to exploit it, perhaps I can.",
"Fair points.",
"A wise decision. Now be wise again and don't try to leave the cave for at least 10 minutes. Goodbye.",
"Till we meet again, Captain ",
" Here is the skull.",
