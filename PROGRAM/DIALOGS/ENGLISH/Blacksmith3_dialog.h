"Captain, I'm glad you found me. I am #sfullname#, the only blacksmith in the archipelago who has specialized in gun repairs. Shall we get down to business?",
"Yes, let's. Tell me what you can do for me.",
"Right now I can repair any gun you have equipped, increasing its level of quality as you desire. Prices depend on the extent of repairs, and I'll need a whole day to do it.",
"Then I'm very glad I found you. Please have a look at the worthless sliver of rust I've been lugging around.",
"Very good to know; I'll remember that. Farewell.",
"I should say, that ",
" of yours couldn't be worse - I'm surprised it's gotten you this far. I'll be glad to mend it for you.",
"I see the ",
" you're carrying is looking a bit shabby. Shall I fire up the furnace?",
"The condition of your ",
" looks fair, captain, but I wouldn't trust it to hold up for long. You ought to let me do something.",
"Captain, I admit I've been admiring your ",
" since you came in. Still, there is a little more I could improve upon.",
"You certainly look dashing with such a fine ",
" at your side. But let me see what more I can do.",
"I hope you don't expect me to put my filthy wheel to that beautiful ",

"It needn't be highest-quality; just up there somewhere, if I can have it for ",
"I only need it a little better than it is now, so here's ",
"Eh... just polish it a bit, since I can only afford ",
"Very well. I may need you again soon.",
"Really, it would cost that much? It's only a piece of tin, after all...",
"I've finished with your gun, #ssir#. Please return if you ever need anything more.",
"#sfirstname#, that's marvellous work! I'll think of you once my guns are worn out again...",
", if you would please. You must equip something I can work with.",
"Let me see what you have in stock.",
" pieces of gold.",
"I brought with me quite a lot of guns. Would you be able to put them all in a better condition?",
"You are talking to #sfullname#! There's nothing I cannot do with guns. However, repairing your collection of scrap metal will cost you, of course.",
"Please repair the most damaged guns, so each is at least of average quality. Take these ",
"If you could bring the guns up to good quality, I'd pay you ",
"I know you're the best gunsmith in the Caribbean, so I'll only accept fine quality. Here's your ",
"I'm not quite sure what guns you are talking about.",
"Sorry, never mind.",
"",
"There's only one quality that's good enough for me - excellent. Take your ",
