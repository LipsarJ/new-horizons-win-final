"Oi, mi madre! Och! Woooaahh... hey there lad or lass (I can't quite see straightly, hee hee), you look like you could use some toughening up. Howsabout you let me etch a pretty picture into your flesh, like all the other sailors are wantin'?",
"Well, my skin does look a bit bare... I almost feel naked standing next to some of the inky demons I've encountered. Why not.",
"Thank you, no. I like my hide just as it is - clean and not raw.",
"So what are ya havin' in mind, matey? My artsy skills ain't that extensive (and admittedly my tools ain't that clean), but you should find something to please y'rself if you give me a day to work.",
"I have in mind the pattern of an ancient tribal warrior, down the arm, so that I might enjoy the same frightening advantage in a duel. 400 is a fair price.",
"Thing is, y'see, there's a special lass I'd like to be reminded of every time I'm out at sea and happen to glance down at my strapping bare chest. I'll give you an even 500.",
"Something inspiring, to fill my men with awe and, well, inspiration whenever they gaze at my rippling bare biceps. Here's 600.",
"A classic anchor, with a ship - I'm sure you get a lot of requests for those. It'd look splendid on my tawny, bronze shoulder, and might encourage the men to fight a little harder at defending their ship. 700 is not too much to ask, I dare say.",
"Let's go really old-school here, chum - I saw this picture once, see, of this fantastic, really ornate design some ancient religious sect would get to invoke divine protection... 800 should be a steal!",
"Well... Actually... I can't think of anything you can do anymore. I'm already tattooed from top till bottom...",
"Naw, none of those appeal, and neither does letting you stick a needle into me. Besides - my mom would kill me if she found out!",
"Now, get yourself comfortable in my parlour here, and don't mind any screams you may hear... those are just your own.",
"Oh boy, how thrilling! Wait'll I show the men this! They'll be sssoooo jealous!",
"Wait, I've... changed my mind. I just remembered I have... allergies to needles... And besides, this isn't covered in my budget.",
"Just get yourself comfortable in my parlour here, and don't mind any screams you may hear... those are just your own.",
