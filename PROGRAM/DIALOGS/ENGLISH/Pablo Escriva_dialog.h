"Yes? Why do you interrupt my work?",
"Sorry, I was just seeing who lives here. I'll go now.",
"Go away! I'm busy.",
"No need to be like that. I'm going!",
"Close the door before the wind scatters my papers! Now, what do you want?",
"My name is #sname#. I am told you are the person to see about unofficial documents, so to speak.",
"You'll have to be more specific than that, #sladlass#! What sort of document do you want?",
"My crew are currently prisoners in #sPort au Prince# fort and I want to get them out. Can you provide something to help with that?",
"Hmm... a simple prisoner transfer form should suffice. The first thing I'll need is a specimen of the governor's signature - all I have at the moment is a signature from the previous governor, which isn't going to fool anyone.",
"I came prepared. Will this do?",
"I'll have to go back to town to get that. Goodbye.",
"Oh, it's you again. Have you managed to get the specimen signature?",
"Yes, have a look at this.",
"Not yet. Time for another walk back to town, I suppose.",
"Excellent! We'll discuss the fee later, but that's going to be enough help for future work that it pays half of it.\nYou'll need a French uniform for this to work as the form is for the transfer of prisoners from one officer to another. Have you a uniform?",
"Yes, I took one a while ago.",
"Do I really have to wear it again? Uniforms are designed for men and are almost painful to wear.",
"Good, then I'll get started. Come back tomorrow. The fee for this sort of work would normally be #sfullprice# gold, but the governor's autograph pays half, so you owe me #shalfprice# if you want your form.",
"Not a problem. Here's your money and I'll see you tomorrow.",
"I don't have that much. I'll return when I do.",
"Ah, the #sperson# who wants to buy my work and couldn't even afford half price. Have you the #shalfprice# gold?",
"Yes, here's the money. See that you have the paperwork done by tomorrow!",
"No, I've yet to find someone who can... 'donate' that much.",
"In that case, I could try a requisition form for slave labour. It will be more expensive, though. Which do you want, the prisoner transfer or the slave requisition?",
"I can tolerate wearing the uniform again. Give me the prisoner transfer.",
"I don't mind paying a bit extra to stay out of that accursed uniform! I'll have the slave requisition.",
"Very well. You're to play the part of a landowner wanting prisoners for some work - building something, perhaps.",
" Ideally you'd be in a fancier dress than that, but with what you're wearing, the guards will be looking at... well, let's just say they won't be paying as much attention to the document.",
"I can live with that.",
"Back for your document, are you? Here you are. The play-acting needed to use it successfully is up to you. Goodbye!",
"Back for your document, are you? Here you are. Don't forget to change into your uniform! Goodbye.",
"Thanks and goodbye.",
"Remember me? I am #sname#. I need your help again.",
"Indeed? And what do you need this time?",
"Commissioning papers which prove I'm a Kapitein in the garrison of #sDouwesen#.",
"Ah, military papers? You've come to the right man, then. I'll need a couple of days to find out which unit is stationed in #sDouwesen# but the papers themselves should be fairly straightforward.\nSo, be back here in three days with 3000 in gold, and you'll get your papers.",
"Very well, I'll see you in three days.",
"You're back, then. Have you the money?",
"Yes, 3000 gold as you asked.",
"And here are your papers - Kapitein ",
