"Governor ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" sent me to retrieve the sacred Incan idol for him.",
"I'm carrying orders to free one of your prisoners.",
"I need to talk to a prisoner.",
"Go on, then. Talk to him.",
"Good.",
"I'm just passing by.",
"Well, generally we don't allow visitors...",
"But this is vital State business!",
"What business? What are you talking about?",
"You must have heard about the child kidnappings and other strange things going on throughout the archipelago. Well, I believe your prisoner can help me get to the bottom of it all!",
"Please - I need to talk to this man!",
"All right. It can't hurt for you to talk to him, I suppose. We hang him in the afternoon anyway.",
"Good. Thank you.",
"You're wasting your time. Although...if you could do me a favor...",
"What favor?",
"My son is getting married soon. I'd like him to have a proper wedding. So, if you want to talk to the prisoner, it'll cost you 5000 gold.",
"Here's your money.",
"I don't think that's going to happen. Can I offer another solution?",
"You tire me. Please leave. You won't be talking to anyone!",
"I'm sorry it's come to this, but I'm afraid you leave me no choice...",
"All right. But I'll be back.",
"What the...",
"You will escort me to the prisoner now, or I'll run you through!",
"You'll pay for this!",
"Probably, but not today. Today, you're my prisoner, and I want to talk to yours.",
"All right! You can talk to him.",
"...",
"Let me see that. Hmm...the Teacher himself, is it? All right, you can take him.",
"Good.",
"All right. But let me see the orders first.",
"Are you serious? You know I work directly for the governor, and you ask me to show you some slip of paper?!",
"I'm sorry, but I've got orders of my own. I'm to send the idol via warship to #sRedmond#, and I'm to arrest anyone who tries to take it without the proper documents. Guards!",
"Blast!",
"I'm afraid I can't give you the prisoner at the moment.",
"What do you mean you can't give him to me?",
"Tell the Governor that the prisoner...escaped last night, and we still can't find him.",
"Oh, you can be sure I'll tell him. And if I were you, I'd find that scoundrel!",
"You might have won this particular battle. But you won't have to wait long for",
"'s revenge.",
"Meanwhile, I'm going to claim this town for myself.",
"What do you want?",
"I need to take the prisoner, Thomas Wolfe.",
"Here, you'll need to sign this release document.",
"...",
"That seems to be in order. You can take Wolfe.",
"Thank you.",
"Some kind of native killed one of my crewmembers without provocation! Can you do anything about it?",
"I'm sorry, captain. We noticed their presence here, but haven't caught them doing anything wrong ourselves. Without firm evidence, we cannot arrest them. If you know anything more, please do report back to me.",
"Seems I was expecting too much from the military once again...",
"Some kind of native tried to kill one of my crewmembers without provocation! Can't you do anything about it?",
"I've seen one of those natives go inside the warehouse close to the fort. It looks like they are up to no good.",
"Thank you for reporting this. Now we know where they are based we will keep an eye on them to make sure they won't become dangerous to people.",
"Pleasure to help.",
"I've overheard some of those natives talking about illegal trade they are conducting here. Shouldn't you do something about that?",
"Do you have any more proof of this besides your word?",
"No, sorry I have not. But I do know they are working from the warehouse close to the fort. And it seems tonight they are going to make a trade on a beach.",
"That won't be enough to arrest them instantly. But we will keep an eye on them. Thanks for the information.",
"I've found some of the goods they were hiding.",
"Thank you for reporting this. The potions are illegal indeed. We will take them from you now and we will arrest those Indians as soon as possible. Thanks for reporting this.",
"Wait! I will be back with information."
