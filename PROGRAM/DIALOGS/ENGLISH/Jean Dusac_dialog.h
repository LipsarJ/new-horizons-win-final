"Hello, #ssir#. You seem to be trying to get into the brothel.",
"Indeed. I need to meet somebody inside.",
"Of course you do. There are usually many meet-worthy somebodies inside. (*Meaningful look*) But not today. The brothel is closed for the time being.",
"Uh? Why? Only minutes ago I heard of somebody being in the brothel right now.",
"Ah. But the brothel was closed a few minutes ago as well. An incident occurred, after which the brothel's mistress decided to close the brothel immediately.",
"What happened? And where did everybody go?",
"A guest hurt one of the ladies in there. That person was removed from the brothel at once, after which the brothel was closed. The brothel's mistress then asked me to keep the house while it's closed.",
"So where can I find this mistress? She is bound to know who were there in the brothel at the moment of the incident.",
"She said she'd leave the town for a while, but she didn't say where she'd go or when she'd be back. The only person who might be able to give you some information on who was in there during the incident is probably the hurt woman herself. She lives in the stonehouse near the port.",
"Excellent! Thanks for the suggestion. I'll pay her a visit.",
