"Good day to you. Might I inquire as to who you are?",
"I'm ",
", captain of the ",
"I am Pieter Boelen, Dutch privateer and captain of the lovely ship, the 'Amsterdam'. Pleased to meet you.",
"So what brings you to this pirate-infested town today?",
"I make a point of helping all honest pirates in this archipelago. This time there are some rumours that the #sSantiago# governor is planning some sort of action against this colony. I'm trying to find out if there is some truth to that. You could help me if you like and earn some money along the way as well.",
"Money? I'm all ears, captain. What do you want me to do?",
"I can't leave this island in case the attack comes while I'm away. I must remain here to defend my friends. However, it would be possible for you to visit #sSantiago# to find out if there is some truth to the rumour.",
"I'd need to hoodwink a #sSantiago# official into giving me that information. That seems like a pretty dangerous mission. They could have me hanged for spying if I'm found out.",
"It's up to you. I'll give you 20000 gold coins if you succeed. Take it or leave it.",
"Very well. We have an accord. I don't mind a bit of danger.",
"I'm sorry. This seems much to perilous for me. I wish you the best of luck defending this colony.",
"Excellent! I hope to hear from you soon. And be careful.",
"Don't worry; I will be. See you in a couple of days.",
"Ah! You're here! Have you found out what the Spanish governor is planning?",
"Yes, I did. Bad news, I'm afraid. The governor of #sSantiago# intends to take over control of this island. His attack will come within the next couple of days.",
"Indeed. Please take your men and go to the lighthouse to prevent the enemy from landing there when they arrive. I will take care of the defence of the port with my trusted ship and crew.",
"Ok. I'll leave right now and prepare a warm welcome for our guests. Good luck to you!",
"AAHHH!! There you are! Have you succeeded?",
"Indeed I have! Let this be a lesson to them Spanish. The pirates will remain free!",
"Excellent, captain! We have been able to prevent them from landing at the port as well. Unfortunately my beautiful ship, the 'Amsterdam', has been damaged during the battle and I can't risk sailing out with her until we've made some repairs. We can't be sure if the Spanish won't try again though, but we CAN be sure that if they try again, they'll bring a much larger fleet. I'll need some assistance from the #sTortuga# pirates. Can you bring me there while my ship is being repaired?",
"Sure. No problem. I will be honoured to have you as a guest aboard my ship.",
"Thanks for your help, captain. Your assistance has been decisive. We couldn't have done it without you. You did much more than you bargained for, so it's only fair that I raise your reward. What do you say to 40000 gold coins?",
"Oh! That is most kind of you. I have other things to do now, but I'm sure that with the help of the #sTortuga# pirates, you will be able to fend off any Spanish attack. I will take my leave of you now, but I hope we will meet again some day. Goodbye and good luck, Pieter!",
