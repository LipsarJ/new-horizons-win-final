"Hello! I am #smyname#, owner of this smithy. What can I do for you today?",
"I don't know. What can you do for me today?",
"Well, if that sword by your side needs a bit of sharpening or polishing, I'm your man. Depending on the quality you want, I'll charge you a reasonable amount. You wait a day, you get your sword back, improved to the agreed standard.",
"Alright, #smyfirstname#. I may very well have work for you.",
"Not today, thanks. Perhaps some other time.",
"Oh dear! What did you do with that ",
", use it to cut down trees? It's a good thing you brought it here before it fell apart entirely!",
"Hmm... that ",
" is certainly in need of a good sharpening. Let me have a look and I'll see what I can do with it.",
"Ho hum, that ",
" must have been built by an apprentice. Or you haven't been looking after it properly. It shouldn't be too hard to give it a proper edge.",
"Not bad, captain, not bad at all. You've evidently been looking after your ",
". And you made the right decision to bring it to me. I'll soon have it back in top condition.",
"I'm impressed! Not often do I see a weapon in such good condition as your ",
". Still, there's definitely room for improvement. Let me put the best possible edge on it.",
"Whoever constructed that ",
" is a true master. I will not swindle you by taking your money and pretending that I can do anything to improve it.",
"I want the blade in the best possible condition, and for your effort I'll pay ",
"There's not much point in polishing it too much, it will soon be in action. But if you get it up to fine condition, I'll give you ",
"Just give it a good sharpening, please. And for your work, here's ",
"I don't want to spend too much on it. Just give it the average treatment, and I'll give you ",
"Fair enough. I'll return if I have something on which you can work.",
"I don't think I can afford that much today. Maybe another time.",
"There, all finished! If you have any more blades requiring my attention, don't hesitate to return.",
"Thanks, I may just do that some time soon.",
"You don't seem to have anything which requires my attention. If you do, please equip it and hand it to me.",
"Let me see what you have in stock.",
" pieces of gold.",
"I brought with me quite a lot of blades. Would you be able to put them all in a better condition?",
"For a big job like that, I'll need my apprentices to help. They're not as skilled as I am, but they should be able to do something.",
"Please have them repair the most damaged blades, so each is at least of average quality. Take these ",
"If they could bring the blades up to good quality, I'd pay you ",
"I hope your apprentices know their trade. I'll only accept fine quality. Here's your ",
"I'm not quite sure what blades you are talking about.",
"Sorry, never mind.",
"An interesting weapon, to be sure. But there's nothing I can do for something that old.",
"There's only one quality that's good enough for me - excellent. Take your ",
