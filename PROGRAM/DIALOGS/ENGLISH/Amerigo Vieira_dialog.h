"Shall we cut someone into pieces, captain?",
"Certainly. Into tiny little pieces...",
"Well, what have we here? A swordsman by the look of you, perhaps ",

" sends his compliments to me again.",
"I doubt that, he described you to me as his personal enemy.",
"Would it surprise you to learn that I too worked for ",
"Mateus Santos",
", as you, apparently, do now, and not so terribly long ago. As a student of the blade I saw becoming a duelist as an ideal means of perfecting my craft; a never ending supply of opponents against whom I might test myself. Sadly, I was never able to find an opponent who could match my skill, but surprisingly this had a strange side effect, in that, ",
"Mateus Santos",
" came to fear me. And a man like him knows only one way to deal with fear: to destroy its source. Since that time a string of bravos has been assigned to challenge me. Will you be the one, I wonder, who will prove a worthy foe?",
"Strangely enough it sounds as if you are indifferent to whether you fulfill the role of the hunter or the hunted.",
"Is there really such a great difference between these roles? Between swordsmen I mean. Allow me to express one caveat for you before we measure our blades; if you prove a worthy opponent and are able to best me, you will, no doubt, assume my place, and you will then become the hunted one.",
"I salute your generosity for having offered this advice, how would you counsel me to proceed from here?",
"Walk away.",
"You counsel me ill, prepare to die.",
"This should come as no surprise to you, but that was the first lesson my fencing master taught me. I don't think I ever truly understood that lesson until just this moment.",
"If only I had learned it sooner, I might have avoided the fate that now is mine. Little does it matter where I go, ",
"Mateus Santos",
"' men will always find me. My only wish is that I fall in honest swordplay, and not through an assassin's foul treachery.",
"I'll bid you farewell then, expressing thanks for the lesson you've taught me here. It is easily seen why you are considered the best swordsman in the archipelago. Good luck.",
"Would you do me the honor then of crossing swords with me? My assignment be damn'ed, but only one of us can walk away from this place. Garde', Sir!",
"Would you be willing to consider an alternative that I suggest? Join me and my crew aboard my ship as an officer and let our former employer's men try and find you there. I can assure you that in my primary profession I am rarely at a loss for opponents, worthy or otherwise.",
"I find there is the ring of merit in your suggestion, captain. Consider my sword as your own. I don't know how to advise regarding Santos, but for myself I'm sure I'll have a better life with him thinking that I'm dead. You should still see Santos for your payment, or he might suspect that something is amiss.",
"I'm pleased to hear it. Welcome to my crew.",
"Well, what have we here? A swordswoman by the look of you, perhaps ",
