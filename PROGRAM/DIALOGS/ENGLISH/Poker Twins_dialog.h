"Let's have your invitation to check it's authentic.",
"Well I won it playing dice so I hope it's real. How could I check?",
"It ought to be, you gave it to me at the last tournament.",
"I think you mean my brother did, but I still have to check it is genuine.",	//3
"I doubt anyone would fake one, my brother would be most upset and take it personally, not something any sane person would want to risk but...",
"(gulp)",
"You know your own business I suppose.",
"The tournament is spread over three days, you play the three other contestants, one on each day.",	//7
"You start a contest with 10000 chips. Each contest lasts a maximum of 50 hands and if that limit is reached whoever has the biggest stack at that point wins. Otherwise if you lose or win all the chips before that then, of course, that is the result.",
"The overall champion is the player with the most individual wins over three days. They get 60000 and the trophy until the next tournament. Of course we look after the trophy for them and give them a small replica to keep.",
"It's a nice little earner for me and my brother so we don't want anyone messing with it or us. Understand?",
"Seems straightforward enough.",
"My brother and I are the final arbiters in all matters - so there are never any problems we can't resolve. Capiche?",	//12
"Crystal clear.",
"Right everything is in order, you can enter the cardroom and take your seat now.",	//14
"What not even a 'good luck'?",
"That's your first bout, come back tomorrow for the next.",	//16
"Fine I could do with a break.",
"Welcome to day two of the tournament, your opponent is waiting. So if you're quite ready to take your seat.",	//18
"So still not even a 'good luck'!",
"Just one more round for you tomorrow.",		//20
"Yes it seems like Deja Vu.",
"Oh it's you at last, we've all been waiting! Get on with it. Sit down for day three.",
"It's well seen you've made your money from this event now.",
"Congratulations to our worthy winner.",		//24
"Thank you for the opportunity to compete.",
"All four contestants are given an invitation for the next tournament in six months. They are yours to keep until then if you want to try your luck again, or trade, or sell. However we will be watching your progress with interest.",
"I'll be back.",					
"You're too late and forfeited the contest, your stakemoney and any future participation. You are also barred from these premises. Now get out.",
"Sorry I got waylaid. Ah well.",
"Take your seat now, your chips are on the table and day one of the tournament can begin.",		//30
"You don't strike me as a gambling type.",			//31
"I didn't strike you at all mate. We don't want an ugly brawl after all!",
"Who are you calling ugly? Perhaps I should get my brother.",	//33
"Why? Do you think you're prettier than him?",
"Look, whoever you are, just talk to my man there.",		//35
"Ok, it was just a misunderstanding I suppose.",
"Commiserations to a gallant loser.",		//37
"Here is your prize money and the miniature of the trophy.",
