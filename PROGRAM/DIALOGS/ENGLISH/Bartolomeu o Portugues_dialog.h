"What do you want?",
"Aren't you that famous English pirate? Peter Blood?",
"You can't help me and I can't help you.",
"I see. Goodbye then.",
"And what if I am?",
"I'm ",
", captain of the '",
"Very well then. Yes, I am Peter. And I have heard of you as well. You're quite a pirate yourself, aren't you? Perhaps you can help me with something.",
"What did you have in mind?",
"I have to save my crew.",
"I don't understand. What happened to your crew that you have to save them?",
"A few weeks ago, I met a Spanish battleship at Campeche. She was a much larger ship than I could take, so I had to flee. Unfortunately we were caught up in a violent storm and my ship sank. Me and my crew washed ashore at #sisland_Cuba#. But we stumbled upon a patrol of Spanish guards while crossing the jungle there. I contrived to escape but my crew was captured.",
"You should be glad to be out of there. Do you really intend to go back?",
"My crew are my friends. I will not leave them. I just need some men and a ship to rescue them.",
"I see. And what should I gain by it?",
"I might be famous, but I am not a wealthy pirate. Even if I save my crew, I won't be able to get another ship. I do not intend to stop pirating though and I'm sure my mates will follow me wherever I go. We have a lot of experience in these waters, so we could join your crew.",
"That sounds pretty good. I accept. Let's set sail for #sisland_Cuba#.",
"I'm sorry. I'm not interested.",
"Fantastic! I'm certain you won't regret having a couple of additional able-bodied hands aboard.",
"I hope so.",
"This island is infested with soldiers!",
"Indeed. The Spanish have patrols everywhere. Let's get to the city quickly! I don't intend to stay here longer than necessary.",
"Dash it! There are Spanish guards coming. They must think we are smugglers.",
"Or they saw you walking around on the ship's deck. I TOLD you to stay below decks. Prepare to fight!",
"Hey! Who are you?",
"My name is ",
". I am a merchant and I came here to sell some goods to your shopkeeper. He's waiting for me.",
"I have to check your affirmation with the shopkeeper. Wait here!",
"Why such precautions? This is the first time I have to be checked while just entering a town to sell off some goods.",
"When pirates are hanged in public, we have to control the identity of all foreigners.",
"A hanging? Who are being hung?",
"The crew members of a certain Peter Blood. He is a very dangerous pirate and the same goes for his crew.",
"When are they going to be hung? And where?",
"Today at noon in front of the church. But you seem to have an awful lot of interest in that hanging. Do you know these pirates? If so, just inform me and I'll arrange some rope for one more hanging.",
"There's no time to lose, Peter! These soldiers aren't going to let us through any time soon, so we must fight our way in!",
"Let's go before more guards show up. We don't have much time; it's almost noon.",
"I agree. I just hope we're not too late.",
"My men are in this small square, waiting for the execution.",
"I see them.",
"So what's your plan?",
"I'm going to talk to the hangman.",
"*Sarcastic Tone* And in the unlikely event that he won't just let my men go?",
"Then I'll let my blade do the talking. While I take care of him, you should attack the soldiers.",
"It won't be easy.",
"I know, but what choice do we have?",
"What are you doing here?",
"I want to have a better view of the execution.",
"You like to show off, don't you? Let's see how you'll be showing off without your head!",
"You are quite happy to kill, aren't you? Hangman must've been the perfect career choice for you. Unfortunately, that career will soon be over.",
"Hah! My men were almost beginning to think I'd leave them to die with the Spaniards! But wait! Where is Emilio?",
"We don't have time to talk right now. We must leave now. There are bound to come more soldiers.",
"We did it! We escaped! That wasn't so hard.",
"No, it wasn't. That's what worries me. It was too easy to get out of the city.",
"Don't worry, be happy!",
"Look! A patrol of Spanish soldiers! Do you really want me to be happy about that? Be ready for another fight!",
"You were right. We weren't safe yet. Let's hope this is the last we'll see of the them Spanish soldiers. I've seen enough iron armour to last me a lifetime.",
"We'd better get off this island quickly. Let's go back to the ship.",
"I think we're safe now. Can we talk for a bit? I have one more favour to ask of you.",
"Let me guess. Emilio?", 
"Exactly. Emilio Soares is my right-hand man. According to one of my crewmen, he escaped on the way to the jail.",
"I see. But where is he now?",
"He told the crew he wanted to get to #sSantiago# to find a ship and leave #sisland_Cuba#.",
"If we are to find that man, we'd best go to #sSantiago# and see what we can find out there. Perhaps some sailor in port will have seen him. But we'd better go there quickly before word of our exploits arrive there.",
"(A few minutes later) My men are aboard!",
"Excellent. Let's get going.",
"Thanks a lot. All my men are rescued now. Now all we need to do is to get away from here.",
"Indeed. How about we go to #sRedmond#? Emilio here seems to like #sRedmond#.",
"That would be great, captain. #sRedmond# is my pied-a-terre. I would love to go there before we begin on our mutual raiding campaign.",
"A raiding campaign? You seem to have quite some plans. Sounds good to me!",
"Hello, captain!",
"Do I know you?",
"Probably not. But I imagine you do know my boss.",
"Perhaps. Who is he?",
"Felipe Cisneros, the governor of #sHavana#.",
"Right. I was rather hoping we'd be rid of the Spanish by now. But here we are, supposedly safe in #sRedmond#, and still we are being confronted by mercenaries.",
"You catch on pretty quickly. This square is surrounded by my men, so don't even try to escape. You and your friend will follow us to our ship and we will deliver you to the governor.",
"I think not. If we fight you now, we'll have a chance of surviving. If we surrender and follow you to the governor, we are sure to be hanged.",
"Have it your way then. Prepare to die!",
"It won't be me who will be dying. I can assure you of that!",
"I hope that'll be the last we hear of that governor.",
"So do I.",
"It seems we finally ended our rescue mission. Thanks a lot for your help. So do you want me to become your officer or not?",
"Of course. That was the deal, wasn't it? There's so much we can still do together! And I like the sound of that raiding campaign!",
"That won't be necessary. Go your own way and try to get a ship for yourself.",
"Excellent! We're going to loot this archipelago!",
"I have no doubt!",
"As you wish. Good luck to you. Maybe I'll see you again some day.",
"Perhaps. Good luck to you too!",
"I'm sorry about that, captain.",
"About what? About you just leaving me and suddenly running away? You better have a good explanation for that!",
"Don't get all worked up, captain. Let me tell you a story. Several years ago I was the proud captain of the best ship I have ever captained, a fast ship named the 'Arabella'. I traded a lot with the Buccaneers in those days and the 'Arabella's' speed allowed me to escape any soldiers who would try to capture me. One day I was in the Buccaneers' Camp at #sisland_Hispaniola#, along with most of my crew, when my sworn enemy, Spanish mercenary Pedro Rivera, took my ship.",
"You mean 'commandeered'. Nautical term. In any case: I heard a lot about that ship of yours, but not about this man you chased into the store.",
"When I and my crew arrived at the shore, the 'Arabella' was just weighing anchor. Four crewmembers of Pedro Rivera were just about to row back to the ship with some of my unloaded goods. We captured them before they could reach the ship.",
"And this was one of the men you captured?",
"Exactly. They couldn't help me find their captain or my ship and they refused point-blank to join my crew, so they were of no use to me and I let them go again. I don't like killing anyone if I don't have to.",
"You seem to be quite a nice guy for a pirate. But I take it you want to get your ship back and you think this man might have rejoined Pedro Rivera's crew so he might know where your ship is?",
"Right again. I would love nothing better than to stand on the deck of my beloved 'Arabella' once more, the wheel in my hands and the wind and the spray of the sea in my face.",
"I'll talk to the sailor discreetly and try to pry some information out of him. He might recognize you if he sees you, so try to be inconspicuous.",
"I'll let you steer my ship on occasion. And one day I will give you a better ship than the 'Arabella'. But I don't think it's a good idea to start on a wild goose chase all over the Caribbean to locate your lost ship.",
"That didn't really get us any further, did it?",
"At least he didn't recognize you. And didn't you notice he said the ship he sails on WASN'T in the port? An ordinary captain would always anchor his ship in port, under the protection of the fort's cannons.",
"So have you found out anything?",
"Yes. The brothel is closed because one of the guests hurt one of the ladies. It might be our man. So I'm going to visit the jail and talk to him.",
"Have you talked to the man in the jail? Is it the navigator we seek? And what about my ship?",
"I talked to him and he indeed is the man we were looking for. I convinced him to help us and he has been very useful so far. You will be pleased to know that Pedro Rivera is at Anse Casse-bois and so is the 'Arabella'!",
"That's very good news! So we are going there right now? I can't wait to meet my good friend Pedro! He has an urgent appointment with the sharp end of my blade.",
"Calm, Peter! What happened to your reluctance to kill anyone?",
"I make an exception for the scum that stole my boat!",
"There are 140 men aboard the 'Arabella'. Are you proposing we take on them all? Just the two of us? I don't think so. I don't want to get killed, nor do I intend to lose any crew members in a full-scale boarding.",
"Good news or bad news?",
"Both. The bad news is that I had to pay a lot of money. The good news is that it was worth it. The navigator has been freed. I will go see him now in prison and explain him the first part of my plan. We will go to the tavern afterwards to arrange the second part.",
"I understand your plan now, but do we really need to wait here? We've been out here for hours. Why aren't we going to meet the navigator?",
"I just need to check that the navigator did his part. Otherwise there's no use in trying to take the ship. Follow me!",
"Look at them! They seem to be in quite a hurry. Can't resist the call of free rum!",
"Yes. These drunkards won't know what happened to them when they find out their ship is gone tomorrow. Let's go to the fort now. Pijuan should be there waiting for us.",
"That saves us two men to fight aboard the ship. Finally I can see my 'Arabella' again. I am impatient to be on her deck again. It has been too long.", 
"I'm quite anxious to get there as well. Do you like swimming, Peter?",
"No, not really. But for my ship I will make an exception.",
"Very well. Let's go.",
"No! Wait! Pedro is MY enemy, not yours. I will fight him.",
"I understand, Peter. But be careful!",
"This scum deserved what was coming to him! Thanks a lot for your help, captain. I never thought I'd ever see the 'Arabella' again!",
"Well done, Peter! Now I see where that Portuguese saying actually came from! I will go ashore to meet Pijuan. I'll meet you later.",
"So you're saying that he might be a crew member of a pirate ship?",
"Indeed. Perhaps even a crew member of the 'Arabella'! We'll pay a visit to the brothel and see if we can get that navigator to help us any further.",
"You have a different plan then.",
"Indeed I do. But it's not going to work without the help of the navigator. He's still in jail, so I need to talk to the governor to get him out of there.",
