"Hello! I am ",
"And I'm ",
"I am pleased to meet you. I am something of a researcher into ancient artefacts - statuettes, carvings, that sort of thing.\nAnd crystal skulls. I have quite a collection - in fact, I could even part with some of them, for the right sort of money.\nBut there is one particular skull which is very rare - I believe there may only be one. As you look like an adventurous sort of #sperson#, perhaps you would be willing to help me acquire it?",
"Welcome back, ",
"! Are you interested in finding the elusive skull missing from my collection, or would you like to buy one of the more common types?",
"Tell me more about this missing skull.",
"What skulls have you for sale?",
"Skulls? Er... not today, thank you.",
"The skulls are all made from crystal. From what I have learned, it seems they were created by the Mayans for some sort of ritual.\nThe ones I can sell are of red, white or blue crystal.",
"I'd like to buy a white crystal skull.",
"Could you let me have a red crystal skull?",
"The blue crystal skull is the one which interests me.",
"On second thoughts, I'm not that interested in buying a skull. But that missing one sounds interesting.",
"Actually, I don't think I'm interested in buying a skull after all. Goodbye.",
"I can let you have a red skull for ",
"The white skull is only going to cost you ",
"The blue skull is the rarest of them, and the most expensive. I can only let it go for ",
" gold coins.",
"We have a deal. Here is your money.",
"I don't have that much. Perhaps another time.",
"I'm not willing to pay that much for a trinket!",
"It was a pleasure doing business with you, ",
"As you wish. Perhaps we can do business another day. Until then, goodbye, ",
"Goodbye.",
"Like all the crystal skulls, the amber skull which I seek was crafted by the Mayans. But from what I have learned, it seems that the skull was stolen by the Carib Indians.\nThe Caribs originally lived on the mainland before they moved out onto the sea which bears their name. One of the tribes which settled among these islands is the one which took the amber skull.",
"Do you know where this tribe can be found?",
"All my research on this subject points to #sisland_Guadeloupe#. But be warned! The Caribs are not like the peaceful Arawaks you may have met elsewhere. They are more likely to be hostile.",
"So they're savages?",
"To some extent. They make war on other tribes, but then we make war on other nations too.\nBut there is some evidence that the Caribs practice ritual cannibalism.\nReally, though, the main reason we think of Caribs as 'savage' is simply that they are more effective than the Arawaks at resisting our intrusion into their land.",
"And what is in it for me if I do bring you this amber skull?",
"What else? Gold, and plenty of it, for such a unique item!",
"Very well. I am sure I can persuade the Caribs to hand it over, whether by trade or by force. I will sail for #sisland_Guadeloupe# as soon as possible.",
"Gold is no use if you're not alive to spend it! I'll not risk taking on a whole tribe of hostile Indians.",
"Excellent! I look forward to seeing the skull take its place in my collection. Farewell, ",
"Fair enough. Let me know if you change your mind - but don't take too long as there may be other adventurers more eager to take the job. Goodbye.",
"Well, ",
"? Have you reconsidered my proposal? Or do you wish to buy one of my other skulls?",
"I have indeed reconsidered your proposal. And I have decided to accept it.",
"How goes your search for the amber skull, ",
"I have yet to find the tribe on #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Welcome back, Capitán ",
"! Have you brought the amber skull?",
"No, I was unable to bring it to you.",
"No, I gave it to the Caribs.",
"Yes. Now, about the gold you promised in return?",
"That is unfortunate. Then we probably have no further business to discuss.",
"Wrong. Tell me about ",
"Really? Tell me all about it, please. If I can not have the skull, perhaps at least I can have your story?",
"<You tell ",
" about your adventures.>",
"And so you gave the crystal skull to the Carib chief? Perhaps it's for the best - it was theirs, after all.",
"The chief felt honour-bound to give me something in return - this tomahawk.",
"True. And I ",
"got my officer back unharmed.",
"was given the antidote to their poison.",
" And now, it is time for me to go. Goodbye, ",
"Let me see... What a magnificent weapon! That is a ceremonial tomahawk - very effective in battle, I'm sure, but it is so much more. The chief would not have given away something like this lightly.\nWould you be willing to sell it? I'm willing to offer 15000 gold coins for it. You'd get maybe a tenth of that from anyone who doesn't know its cultural value.",
"No, I think I'll hold onto it. I'll never get anything like it again.",
"15000, you say? Very tempting. Alright, we have a deal.",
"For something as important as you say this is, I'm sure you could do better than that. Make it a round 20000 and we have a deal.",
"You drive a hard bargain! But I must have that tomahawk. Very well, 20000 it is.",
"It was nice doing business with you.",
"First, how did you get the crystal skull?",
"The Caribs ambushed me. They ",
"took one of my officers hostage.",
"said the arrows which hit me were coated with a poison which would take two months to kill me.",
" But I can get replacement officers easily enough in the tavern.",
" But I don't believe them. A poison either kills you or it doesn't. It doesn't wait two months.",
" So I pretended to go along with them. Then, when I returned to the Caribs, I fought them and kept the skull.",
"I'm glad I'm not one of your officers, if you sacrifice them so readily! But I am willing to offer 20000 gold coins for the skull.",
"Don't be so sure. The Caribs are not good at bluffing but they are good with poisons. If they say they hit you with a poison which would kill you in two months, you should believe them. And that means our deal changes.",
"Very cunning! As for payment, I am willing to offer 20000 gold coins for the skull.",
"That sounds like a fair price for what it took to get the skull. Very well.",
"You're changing the deal? How, exactly?",
"You have something I want - that skull. I have something you want - the antidote to your poison. So I propose a simple exchange.",
"It seems I have no choice. Here is the skull. Now give me the antidote!",
"I'm still not convinced. I want the gold you promised!",
"Wait here. I shall get it from my store room.",
"I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you if you try to double-cross me.",
"It won't do you much good if you die before you can spend it. And I would imagine that most of your two months are already gone.",
"And now, is there anything else I can do for you?",
"Yes. You can tell me about ",
". How did he know where to find me?",
"? I have used his services in the past. He is... good at acquiring things.",
"Was good, you mean. Past tense. He's shark food now. But that does not answer my question. How did he know about the skull? Did you decide to send him as well?",
"No, no! I'd already given you the job - there would be no sense in sending someone else as well!\nBut I confess that I did discuss the skull with one of my colleagues. It was probably he who decided to send ",
" to get the crystal skull for him. Perhaps he intended to sell it to me, or perhaps he intended to claim credit for my research. Either way, I shall have words with him, you may be sure of that!",
"I'd rather like to have a pointed discussion with this 'colleague' myself. Who is he?",
"Your 'pointed discussion' probably involves your weapons. I can't condone such an act. But be sure, after I've finished with him, he'll be thoroughly ruined. If, on your next visit to this town, you see a beggar in town, it could be him.",
"Very well, I suppose that's a fitting revenge. Well, goodbye for now.",
"This is what I have prepared, based on my research into Carib poisons. Drink it all, preferably all in one go. It tastes foul but it should cure you.",
"Should? Can't you give a better assurance than that?",
"Nobody has ever reported that it didn't work.",
"Well, no. If it didn't work, they wouldn't, would they? But if this one doesn't work, some of my crew will make sure that you don't outlive me by very long.",
"! Would you like to buy one of the more common types of crystal skull?",
