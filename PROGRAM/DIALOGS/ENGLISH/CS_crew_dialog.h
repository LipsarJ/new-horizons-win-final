"Any orders, cap'n?",

"Return to the ship. Order the medicine to be brought here. Quickly!",
"Aye aye, captain!",
"There they are, #ssir#!",
"Those are probably just scouts. Wait until the main group arrives.",
"Those mules must be carrying a fortune!",
"Yes, and they seem to have stopped for a break. Let's go and get the silver!",
"We did it, #ssir#!",
"Yes, and now we need to get the silver back to the ship. Look after the donkeys, and stay back a bit. Don't move ahead until I've checked that it is safe.",
"We made it back to the shore, #ssir#!",
"Yes, but there's a Spanish ship out there. I want to get back to our ship before she attacks us, so get the silver loaded quickly! ",
