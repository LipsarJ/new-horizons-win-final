"Your grandfather killed my great-grandfather. Prepare to die.",
"I don't even know who my father was, let alone my grandfather, so whatever he did, I had nothing to do with it. I'll be going now. If that's alright with you.",
"My name, in your tongue, is ",
". Who are you?",
"I am ",
"Why are you here?",
"Er... because your warriors attacked me and brought me here?",
"Do not pretend to be a fool! Though you have not seen our people, our people have been watching you. You seek something. What?",
"Nothing in particular. I'm just looking around.",
"I'm looking for an amber crystal skull. I'm told that a tribe of Caribs on this island may have it. If that's you, would you be willing to trade for it?",
"I say again, do not pretend to be a fool and do not mistake me for one! This time, tell truth or die! Why are you here?",
"Ah, the ancient skull. It is ours but we do not have it.\nWhen our ancestors lived in the great land in the west, they took the skull from their enemies. When they moved to these islands, they settled on Madinina.\nWhen your people drove my people from Madinina, we were forced to move here. We could not bring the skull or your people might have found it. So we hid it.",
"Madinina? I do not know that name. Where is it?",
"In your language, Madinina means 'Land of Flowers'. From here it is to the south. It is a twin island.",
"Twin island? That would be #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#, which is indeed south from here.",
" But that is #snationdesc#. I am not #snationdesc#!",
"You are from across the great sea, as are those who drove us from Madinina.",
"And to us, you look like the Arawak -",
"You dare compare the Caribs to the Arawak! You will die for such an insult!",
"No, not at all. To us, you look like Arawak but you are not Arawak. To you, I appear #snationdesc# but I am not #snationdesc#.",
"Ah, so your people have different tribes as our people have different tribes.\n",
"You are familiar with Madinina? Then you will help us recover what is ours.\nYou will travel to the island. ",
" will go with you. He will guide you to the hiding place of the skull. You will bring it back to us.\n",
"We will keep one of your companions as hostage. If you return the skull to us within two months, your companion will be returned unharmed.",
"The arrows which struck you carry a powerful but slow poison. If death does not find you earlier, the poison will kill you in two months. Bring the skull to us before then and we will give you the antidote.",
" And if you do return the skull to us, you shall receive a reward.",
"I don't have much choice, do I? If your people can take me back to where they found me, I'll return to my ship and sail for #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# as soon as possible.",
" is not with you? Where is he?",
" tried to steal the crystal skull from me and I was forced to kill him to defend myself.",
" died fighting valiantly to defend the skull, and me, from our enemy. In his memory, I have brought the crystal skull to you.",
"You lie! ",
" knew where the skull was hidden. He would have found it. Perhaps it was you who stole it from him!\nOr perhaps he trusted you to carry the skull. He would then only attack you if he thought you betrayed that trust.\nEither way, you die now!",
"That suits me. I get to kill you, take ",
"my officer",
"the antidote",
" and keep the skull.",
"The loss of ",
" is a tragedy to our people. But you show respect and your words do you honour. If you give me the crystal skull, I shall ",
"release your companion.",
"give you the antidote.",
"Certainly. Here is your crystal skull.",
"No deal. I'll be taking ",
" and I'll keep the skull for myself.",
"You have shown yourself to be a #sperson# of honour. You may now have ",
"your companion back",
"Thank you, ",
"There is more. When you first agreed to bring us the crystal skull, I promised you a reward. Wait here. I go to fetch it.",
"Very well, I'll wait.",
"Lying worm! My warriors will now crush you underfoot!",
"They don't have big enough boots.",
"Welcome home, ",
"! How went the search for the crystal skull?",
" speaks well of you! If you give me the crystal skull, I shall be happy to ",
"You have shown patience in waiting. Now you shall receive your reward.",
"I am sure it will be worth the wait.",
"This tomahawk has been in our tribe for many years. It was used by our great chief Walking Eagle when he led our people to victory against the first white invaders of Madinina. Few white faces have seen it and until today, none have survived.\nBut you have returned our most sacred relic. Honour demands a great gift in return. And so I present this tomahawk to you. Carry it with honour.",
"Thank you! It is indeed an honour to receive such a fine weapon. And now I must leave. Goodbye.",
