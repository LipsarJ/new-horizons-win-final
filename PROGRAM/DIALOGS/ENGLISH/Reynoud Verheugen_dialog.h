"Can't you see I'm talking with my friend the shopkeeper?",
"I'm sorry to bother you. I really need to ask you a question.",
"Very well then. Ask away. But keep it short, please.",
"I am looking for the British frigate 'Lightning'.",
"So?",
"This ship you saw sinking, was she a frigate?",
"I was working at Baie d'Orient. It was dark, it was raining, visibility was bad and the ship was many miles away from the shore. Do you really think I could tell you the name of the ship?",
"Of course not. I just want to know if she could've been a frigate.",
"Let me think. Yes, she might have been a frigate. She had three masts and looked pretty sleek from afar.",
"Can you tell me what happened?",
"You already know. She sank.",
"Surely a well-built frigate won't just sink in a storm?",
"Do you really want to know what happened? You will think I'm crazy.",
"Please do tell.",
"The ship did not sink because of the storm. She was pulled under the water.",
"Pulled, you say? Pulled by what?",
"I'm not sure. It seemed to be a monster; it looked almost like a giant octopus. After that, a strange ship appeared. It seemed she emerged from the water!",
"Did you tell the governor this?",
"Of course. But he didn't care. As long as the monster sinks only English ships, it is fine by him.",
"Thanks a lot. I will pay a visit to Baie d'Orient. If your story is true, I should find some debris there.",
"I am looking for the French frigate 'La Foudre'.",
"Of course. But he didn't care. As long as the monster sinks only French ships, it is fine by him.",
