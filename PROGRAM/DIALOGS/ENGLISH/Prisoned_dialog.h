"Captain, captain! Please listen to me! I crave forgiveness, captain!",
"Ransoming you sounds pretty good. ",
"We shall put your word to the test. We have arrived at ",
"I'm afraid my crew longs to see ye as a bloody lump of meat. I may just have to swab my splintery deck with your face.",
"Shut up.",
"My family is hardly what you'd call rich. And I sincerely doubt my government will care about my capture.",
"Well, what else do you want me to do with you? Making you walk the plank is always an option, I suppose....",
"I don't think that I have much of a choice. And what awaits me on dry land is naught but cold hard misery and financial struggle. I used to serve ",
"And what can you do as an officer?",
"One request, captain. Please allow me to die in a dignified way. With weapon in hand.",
"That is too much honour for a scoundrel like you. You shall be flogged and salt shall be rubbed into your gaping wounds! Oh, and then you'll be hanged. That too. Oh boy, I AM in an evil mood today!",
" golden piastres for me and a safe return to your family for you!",
" and now will serve you. So speak to me as you speak to your officers.",
"That slimy behaviour of yours is not going to help. I may have to reconsider.",
"Are you satisfied, captain?",
"Maybe... Maybe... And how much would I need to pay to ensure your loyalty?",
"Such 'professionals' as you I can find in any port. I'm not interested.",
"What do you think about ",
"You have a most unusual sense of humour, my friend. Do you really think you are in a position to argue with me?",
"Very well, I accept. Welcome aboard. Just know that if you betray me, not even God can save you from my wrath.",
"I shall think about it.",
"Well, maybe you'll agree on ",
"Very well, then. But for this money, you had better serve me well!",
"I understand my position, captain, but my self respect will not allow me to accept anything less.",
"You'll not be sorry about your decision, captain.",
"I do hope so... For YOUR sake!",
"The people who I used to serve in ",
" trusted me and counted on me. Better that I should die than to stain my name.",
"Such foolishness! A most most dangerous and expensive vice. Be warned that it may cost you greatly.",
"Very well, I shall give you a fighting chance. Let our skills with a blade decide who is superior!",
"Don't make me laugh! Your allies will pay a pretty penny. And if I cannot get to them, the pirates will take you for sure. Don't worry, I'll ransom you in the first port I can!",
" golden piastres right now? I managed to hide a sum of money when your cutthroats grasped me, see.",
"No, that will not do at all. I intend to collect the FULL ransom sum!",
" and I expect to be paid in full!",
"Don't be so dramatic. There shall be no need for it. Perhaps you would consider serving me as an officer?",
"Now don't overreact, captain! What would you say if I would offer you ",
"Hmm.... Better than nothing, I suppose. Give me the money and Vaya Con Dios!",
"We have arrived at ",
"Well, that's a bit of a sad story. You've got me all in tears! You shall be happy then to know that we are anchored at ",
" and I am letting you go. Your road home will be hard and dangerous enough as it is, so take these weapons with you. Farewell and good luck.",
" piastres, ",
" island, I'll release you.",
" and I will let you go. Try not to meet with me anymore. Fare thee well.",
"I've seen enough blood and I care not about money. As soon as we drop anchor near a ",
"Have you not considered the wellbeing of the sharks? They are very hungry! Is that not a noble death?",
"Captain, you are a noble ",
"What? What is that? Sorry, mate. My purse is telling me that you'll have to remain a prisoner for a while longer.",
"We will get to a ",
" island soon. You'll see your family again.",
"I'll knock out your teeth - that will teach you to be quiet.",
"Stand up when talking with a captain! We can at least TRY to behave like civilized people here.",
"Mercy! What destiny have I been allotted by thy cruel machinations? You have my life in your hands!",
"Well, that's more like it! Now we can discuss what to do with you.",
"I have not decided yet. I'll let you know when I have made up my mind.",
"Traitor! You promised that I would be well treated when I surrendered!",
"I lied. Now, are you going to walk to the mast to be hanged, or do I need to chop off your legs and carry you?",
"Did I? In that case, I'd better give you a chance. If you can outswim the sharks and make it to land, you can live. Good luck!", 
"It will be hard on them, but my family can raise that amount. If you will release me, you will be paid what you ask.",
