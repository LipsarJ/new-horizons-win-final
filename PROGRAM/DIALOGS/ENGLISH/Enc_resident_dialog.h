"Welcome to my humble house. I am ",
"Ah, a visitor! Come in, come in. My name is ",
"Come in and take a seat by the fire. You've come to the house of ",
"Thanks and hello. I'm ",
"and I'm pleased to make your acquaintance,", 
"Well met, ", 
"Hello again, ", 
". What brings you here?",
"I'm wounded. Can you help me?",
"I'd love to chat a bit...",
"I'm in a talking mood. Do you have time for a chat?",
"I have some time to spare and would like to spend it in amiable company.",
"Oh, is it already that late? I've got to go, goodbye.",
"Oh, you look terrible! Hmm, fever, swollen limbs, darkening around your injuries... You`ve got gangrene! Well, that is a rather common disease amongst sailors nowadays. Small wonder given our sanitary conditions, and the tropical climate isn´t helpful either. As everybody knows all disease is being transmitted by foul air and the Vapours. And of those we have plenty here. Well, one just has to accept illness as a fact of 17th century life, and pray that...",
"I don´t need a medical lecture on gangrene, I need a cure for it, and that fast!",
"Hey, hold it, old prattler! Has it occured to you that I am about to die? HELP ME!",
"A curse on the couchcaptain who brought this disease here! But dammit, every misfortune can be turned into an asset if you take on the challenge in the right spirit. Let´s not waste a minute whining but procure some cure. IMMEDIATELY!",
"You are a welcome guest, and I'd love to hear a sailor's stories...",
"And I would like to hear about the latest scandals of the town...",
"So let's open this bottle and settle down....",
"Oh, how terrible! I'll clean and dress your wounds, and then you will stay in bed till tomorrow. You need a rest, believe me.",
"Thanks, you are too kind. Damn, am I tired, I think I'll sleep right away...",
"Fascinating! Please do go on...",
"Most interesting! Tell me more...",
"I don`t think I can wait that long. Thank's, but I must leave.",
"Calm down, I still have my late mothers medicinechest. Here, look at all those bottles: something will surely cure you, but I have no idea what all those outlandish names mean. You must decide what I shall put on your gangrenous wounds!",
"Fortunately have I recently bought a medicinechest. Was a real bargain, it once belonged to a Spanish surgeon who died of... eh, ehem... gangrene. But nevermind that, there is such an impressive array of bottles with scientific names, one will surely be suitable for woundtreatment. But which one?",
"Well, last year I bought a medicinechest but never used it. Forgot that I can´t read... But you will surely be able to choose the right remedy. Here, have a look at the labels...",
"28",
"Out! Out, I say, before you stink up the house! We'll have no pirates here...",
"It'd be difficult to make the stench worse. But I'm leaving.",
"Hey, what are YOU doing here? This is no place for privateers of ill repute. Get out!",
"Bah, I wouldn't stay in this stinking shack anyway.",
"Oh, it`s YOU! Your reputation is not the best. Get your butt out of my house!",
"Relax! I'm leaving. Maybe you'll be more sensible later...",
"You spent the night in good care and feel better.",
"But your host looks tired. You should take your leave now!",
"You chat for hours and learn a lot about the town.",
"Take the ethanol.",
"Use the isopropyl.",
"vinegar it is.",
"Let´s try mercury.",
"Hamamelis Virginia sounds good.",
"Try Cera Alba.",
"Use the potassium.",
"chamberlye it is.",
"How about sodium.",
"Damn your junkpile of quack remedies! Before I die I´ll rather try my own medical mixture! ",
"Good idea! Lie down now and let me take care of your injuries, and in the morning you will be fit to slaughter skeletonpirates by the dozen again. ",
"Skeletonpirates? Bah, are you trying to lull me with fairy tales? Don´t bother, I´m already asleep... ",
"I hope I do not wake up as skeletonpirate myself... ",
"I hope you know what you are doing...",
"You have such a nice house here, it would be a real pity if it would burn down tonight, wouldn´t it, eh? And houses burn oh so easily, right? It would take just a tiny little match like this one here to turn your home into a pile of ashes, or even your very own pyre, got it? But do not worry, you just have to pay me 1000 gold and I´ll make sure that nothing will happen to you, understand?",
"But I do not understand why paying Gold to you would protect me from such an accident?",
"You speak in riddles, man! What has my safety to do with you?",
"But I am always so careful with fire, I am sure that nothing will happen.",
"Are you really so dumb? If you don't pay me your house will burn down. Got it NOW?",
"I am talking about a MANMADE accident, oaf! Not to say PRIVATEERmade.",
"Listen, you can not guard your house all the time, while I could come back ANYTIME...",
"Ah, got it! You want to extort protectionmoney from me! Well, why didn't you say so in plain words, such demands are commonplace here. Well, I am willing to pay, although I don't have 1000 Gold. But you can take all you can find in my chest, allright?",
"Hmm, well, before I waste more time blackmailing someone who is too dumb to be frightened I'll take what you have...",
"WHAT? Are you trying to threaten ME? No, you won't extort anything from me, even if you kill me! And I´ll make sure that everybody here will soon know what a RASCAL you are!",
"SIGH! I give up, you are to dumb to be threatened.",
"I still do not see how you could protect me from fire. You are at sea most of the time.",
"Oh, you are really confusing me, mate. Are you the new fire inspector or what?",
", you still haven´t fully convinced me of the logical conection between the potential loss of value of my real estate and the procurement of a not insubstantial financial subsidy to the benefit of your person... Ha, now yer see yerself what confusing speech means!",
"Grrr... YOU NO PAY HOUSE FINITO!",
"Oh, please, don't you read any mafianovels? I am supposed to make a veiled, vague threat and you are supposed to make a horrified face and pay.",
"Remember, such fires usually start under the bedplace of the houseowner. But I bet you pighead wouldn't even wake up.",
"I have a problem with the townguards...",
"Oh, yes, the guards ARE a problem... They are nothing but a bunch of idlers and corrupt cowards. Only the worst scum of the European armies volunteers for service in these godforsaken colonies. They usually turn a blind eye if there is a fight, they only interfere if some influential citizen is being attacked. But if they feel threatened they strike back in blind fear, and attack anyone wielding a blade, often confusing friend and foe in their panic. But what exactly is your problem with them?",
"Ah, never mind! I'll solve my problems my way.",
"I would like them to protect me from those pestering streetcriminals that swarm the streets nowadays. They have become a real plague lately, damn that couchcaptain that brought them here... And the guards don't lift a finger to help me!",
"They seem to think that I am a criminal. They keep going after me.",
"Well, what do you expect? You are a foreigner to them, and you look like a rogue... But I know the commander of the townguard quite well, I think I can do something for you. If you give me 100 Gold I'll pass it on to him, and that will surely improve your relation with the guards.",
"Thanks, but I don't wanna be a cheat. I can get along with that bunch of military morons without squandering my money for bribes. ",
"Oh, yes, please go and have a word with the commander. The guards may be incompetent, but there are soo many of them... I'll wait here till you have talked with him.",
"Allright, I could convince the commander that you are a honest citizen worthy of protection. But you are not to cause any unrest and fighting, and should you be involved in the schemes of some hostile power you will be treated like any other traitor.",
"Ah, I am very grateful for your mediation. Thanks and goodbye.",
"79 ",
"Do you have a job for an able swordsman?",
"Do you know how someone with good fighting skills could earn some money?",
"Have I already told you that I am the best bodyguard in town? Do you know someone who needs protection?",
"Good that you ask. There have recently been cases of burglary in the neighbourhood. Someone broke into several houses by lifting tiles from the roof and climbing into the attic. Would you guard my house this night? Tomorrow you'll get a nice reward for breakfast.",
"I would certainly sleep better if you would guard my house tonight. Times are unsafe, and those stupid guards are unable to keep order. Only yesterday a mob set fire to the attic of a house down the alley because the owner refused to pay protection money. Would you guard my house this night? In the morning I'll reward you lavishly.",
"Well, you could protect me tonight against a mob of thugs who terrorize the neighborhood. Would you believe it, two nights ago they climbed over the roof into poor parson William's bedroom window, beat him up and abused his wife. Terrible times! Your presence would make me sleep a lot better, and I'll pay for your effort.",
"Of course will I protect a friend in danger. Rest assured, you will be perfectly safe tonight.",
"Don't worry, I'll stay overnight and you will be perfectly safe.",
"No thug or burglar will dare to enter this house while I am here. Have a good night.",
"Well, it's already dawning. Thanks for staying with me all night long.",
"Ah, the sky is already becoming grey. Looks like we made it through the night. Your presence was a great comfort, thank's a lot.",
"Finally it's morning! Your presence seems to have safeguarded my estate. You are an excellent bodyguard.",
"Oh, don't mention it. I would have guarded your house even if you had not promised me a REWARD.",
"Ah, that reminds me, I promised you a reward... Eh... I am afraid that I haven't enough money to pay a bodyguard. But take this piece of jewelry. It belonged to my late mother, and I kind of cling to it, but you surely deserve a reward for risking your life for me.",
"Ah, that reminds me, I promised you a reward... Eh... Hey, why are the dogs raising such row? Is there someone in the garden? Or even on the roof?",
"Ah, yes, your reward, how about... Wait! That noise on the attic is to loud to stem from the rats...",
" Hey, what's that sound? This scratching, like a crowbar on wood... the roofboards...",
"What? WHERE?",
"Thank's a lot. I'll keep that gem in honour and high esteem as a token of our friendship in arms. (I wonder how much money that will fetch at the junkman...) ",
"Oh, I just can't take your family souvenir away from you. Keep it, it was a pleasure to help you.",
