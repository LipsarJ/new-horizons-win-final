"Welcome to my tavern, stranger. My name is ",
". What brings you to my humble establishment? Do you need a place to rest?",
"Thank you. My name is ",
". I'm here on business.",
"My name is ",
", and you can spare your hospitality. I'm here on business.",
"Welcome, #ssir#! What do you want?",
"I need some information, and I find the local innkeeper is usually the man to ask.",
"I'm looking to hire some sailors for my ship.",
"Point me to the patrons here who might be looking for a job. I need to add to my crew, and I don't mind if they're cutthroats.",
"Do you have a room? I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"Do you have a free bed in this hovel?",
"I don't have any business with you right now. Goodbye.",
"That's true. I hear most everything. What do you want to know?",
"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"I don't have any questions at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"Maybe they have. There are many rumors around.",
"Hurry. I'm a busy man.",
"It's a little too late in the day to find good sailors. They'll all be asleep or passed out by now. Come back in the morning - or you can spend the night here at the tavern.",
"All right. Do you have a room?",
"I don't need a room at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"I do have a vacancy. How long are you going to stay?",
"Overnight.",
"Just until dark.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"What - does that come with a personal staff? I'll pass.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"That's too much. I'll stay in the tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Dear visitors! Please stop this outrage! Don't force me to call the guards!",
"All right, all right! I'm already gone!",
"If he is they prefer to sail in with less satellites, you know this", 
"Yes, I forgot. Alright, I'll come back later, when I have fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've done caused too much trouble for my country",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You arrived just in time. A merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You should talk to him. There he is, just coming in to the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody like that at the moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm, then I will wait.",
"Excuse me, but do you have a cousin named Sven?",
"What's this? A kind of secret code?",
"No, but I once had a barber named Dominique.",
"Bugrit! Bugrit! Millennium Hand and Shrimp.",
"I am rubber, you are glue!",
"Oh, well ... nevermind, ",
"Could you stop talking gibberish and return to serious business, please?",
"Well, close enough. As you seem to be a member of the Secret Brotherhood of the Three Headed Monkey, I'll show you the map to the Great Riches Beyond Imagination. If you're interested, that is.",
"Of course I am, brother.",
"Seen it? Seen it? It's deep down below the monkey head, they say. Sadly nobody knows where the island is located, but it is out there somewhere. I can feel it. The origin of the Secret Brotherhood of the Three Headed Monkey lies there.",
"Together with the Great Riches Beyond Imbecility, I reckon?",
"Imagination! Great Riches Beyond Imagination. Anyway - if you find out more, let me know and we could start an expedition.",
"Sounds, er ... interesting. Do you by chance know anyone - another brother - who could provide some more details?",
"You could try and seek the Grandmaster of the Brotherhood, if you're ready for The Three Trials. Don't ask me, who the Grandmaster is. Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.",
