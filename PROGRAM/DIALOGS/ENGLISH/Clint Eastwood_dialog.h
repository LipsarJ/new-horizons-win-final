"Go ahead, make my day!",
"You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?",
"Ah, the good, the bad and the ugly! You've come to do business, I trust? I've no time for time wasters. So why don't you go ahead and make my day?",
"All right, I might have some gems of interest. But first I'd like some information.",
"Now what do you want?",
"The Brinkley woman has been killed. So, what would you be knowing about that then?",
"You mean one gem for another?",
"Something like that.",
"Show me a sample of what you have then.",
"Cast your eyes on these diamonds.",
"Is that it? I've seen more sparkle in the bar-keeper's eyes on a Monday morning!",
"Oh! come on be reasonable.",
"I tried being reasonable, once.. I didn't like it",
"You mean, you won't do business with me?",
"Hmm! You've got some nice diamonds there. We could do business after all. What is it you want to know?",
"I'm looking for Annabella Brinkley, have you seen her?",
"She went into that cabin over there a while ago. I haven't seen her come out since.",
"Thanks. I'll go and have a look.",
"I'd be knowing that she'd been pretty careless, don't you think?",
"Is that all you've got to say on the matter?",
"All I know is, I was out here, and you were in there. Now who's most likely to have topped her, me or you?",
"[Sputtering] But we only just got here! and the body's cold.",
"Cold? That reminds me, what about the ice you are carrying?",
"Diamonds! Diamonds! Is that all you can think of? What about the dead woman in there!",
"I don't want to buy her. Not much call for corpses around here.",
"I mean... Who could have done it?",
"I'll tell you what. You sell me six of those diamonds for 20,000 pieces of gold and I'll tell you who I think might have killed her, and a further piece of information you will find of great interest, plus I'll throw in part of a treasure map as a bonus.",
"O.K. It's a deal. Here you are. Now, who do I need to find? And where are they?",
"A man by the name of Brock was her partner. If I were you I'd look in Speightstown. That's his base of operation. He also had some prisoners with him when he left.",
"Prisoners! Ah! Thank you. We'll be on our way now.",
