"Welcome aboard...Captain?",
"Captain ",
"I perfectly know what you're looking for : Miss Elizabeth Shaw.",
"Right. Who told you this?",
"The Governor of #sPhilipsburg#. You could say that he works for me.",  // TALISMAN - to remove wrong Governor name - Dickman not used by game other dialogs also corrected
"I understand. I had the feeling he concealed the truth from me. But why did you kidnap the Governor Shaw's daughter? For a ransom?", 
"I'm not a pirate like others, Captain, I was looking for love and I have found it since I met her.",
"And she loves you?",
"Humm..humm... not for now but she'll love me in the future. She doesn't seem to appreciate life aboard yet...",
"Yes? Maybe I can solve your problem.",
"How?!",
"Put her temporarily under the authority of the Governor of #sPhilipsburg# and in exchange I'll convince Governor Shaw to give up trying to bring her back to #sisland_Cayman#. As proof of goodwill, let me take her to #sPhilipsburg#.",
"NO!... It's too risky.... I don't trust you.",
"Why? While I was waiting for you, a crewmember told me you like playing Liar's dice.",
"Yes, but why do you talk of this now?",
"Why don't we play and whoever wins takes Elizabeth Shaw to #sPhilipsburg#.",
"NO!.... I'll accept your suggestion to put her under the authority of the Governor of #sPhilipsburg#. But I'll take her there.",
"Are you afraid of playing with me?",
"Are you joking? I consider myself to be the best player. Take the cup and the dice, I'm going to teach you a lesson.",
"How many rounds?",
"Only one. Let's play! I bid four fours.",
"humm...I bid four fives.",
"Ahah! seven fives!",
"Eight fives!",
"You lie! Show me your dice!",
"I have four fives and you too. You lost.",
"Dash it! Ok, you can take her but don't try to deceive me otherwise I'll kill you!",
"Understood, see you at #sPhilipsburg#.",
"Traitor! Do you think you can take me for a ride!",
"Sorry Captain!",
"And do you think I'm going to forgive what you did?!",
"I'm not sorry for what I did but for what I'm going to do.",
"What did you do!",
"You know perfectly well what I did. Elizabeth told me during the voyage that you can only set foot on land once every ten years, so when I saw you near the sea I immediately thought to push you into the water. Now, you can't recapture her.",
"DAMN YOU ",
"Did you really think you could escape from me if you continued to sail the seas ",
"Um...",
"Huh Hah... Deal! You shall never hear from me again Captain ",
", unless our agreement is broken!",
"That is good to hear.",
