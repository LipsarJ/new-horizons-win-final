"Don't waste my and your time, #ssir#, we don't deal with civilians here. The only exception are loyal privateers with a Letter of Marque.",
"Couldn't I prove my loyalty and commitment to the war effort with a.. err.. financial contribution to you.. err.. I mean the Crown's warchest? Lemme see.. How much can I spare.. considering the state of my tub.. Let's say.. ",
" Gold? Don't bother with a receipt, I trust that you won't keep single a coin for yourself..(WINK)",
"But I HAVE a Letter of Marque..",
"Hey, don't you know me anymore? I paid you already before..",
"My, my, you seem to be a very busy and important man. What exactly is your job.. err.. duty?",
" Too bad.. Well, looks like my carpenter will have to repair my ship on his own. Farewell, brasshead.",
"I am the Commissioner of the Naval Dockyard. The Navy Board despatched me to supervise the principal officers of the yard. Having a Naval dockyard here in the Caribbean is of vital importance cause without constant repair our Leeward Islands squadron would soon be immobilised by rot, Taredo worm and Hurricane damage.\n Sailships decay so fast in tropical waters that we are always short of stores and manpower. So I must ask you to leave me alone now, we can spare none of our resources for civilian ships. The only exception are loyal privateers with a Letter of Marque, cause they in turn supply us with captured stores and prizeships.",
"You, #ssir2#, are nothing but an imposter! Your relation to the Crown is certainly NOT good enough for a Letter of Marque. Master at Arms, arrest this cheat!",
" You are just too well informed about my RELATIONS.. Well, people who know too much must be killed. Maybe your successor will be less nosy..",
"Really? Well, who cares, it's only a scrap of paper anyway. Well, I just remember that the drydock right in front of this office has become vacant this very morning and will not be occupied for a week. Put your ship in there, and I'll ask the Master Attendant to have it careened and overhauled. After the regular working hours, of course.",
"Of course. Knowing the public service I bet your workers will have enough energy left after their official work..",
"Ah, I see! Well, I just remembered that the dock has become vacant this very morning and will not be occupied for a week. Put your ship in there, and I'll ask the Master Attendant to have it careened and overhauled. You'll only have to pay ",
" for the material.",
"Now if that ain't a bargain! I'd be dumb if I would refuse such an offer.",
"I flatly deny that, do you hear me, #ssir#? Cause that would have been an irregular procedure. We have never met before! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? (WINK)",
"Oh no, not with me! You just pretend that we haven't met before so that you can extort another bribe...",
"Ah, oh yes, I understand. (WINK) Must have confused you with another officer, small wonder.. those uniforms look all the same to me. A nice day to you, dear Sir.",
" Indiscreet idiots must be silenced.. ALARM!! THIS IS A SABOTEUR! #sGENDERSubj# HAS A BOMB, KILL #sGENDERObj# ON THE SPOT!!!",
" Those naval blockheads will hardly believe a privateer accusing their superior..",
"SHHH!! Dear #ssir2#, be more discreet, I beg you! The Navy Board has already become suspicious of my.. Ah, never mind, but if you don't raise a fuss I'll grant you access to a dock that has become vacant this very morning and will not be occupied for a week. Put your ship in there, and I'll ask the Master Attendant to have it careened and overhauled. After the regular working hours, of course.",
"Swell! See, with the right arguments one can convince even naval blockheads..",
"#ssir#, are you trying to corrupt an officer of His Royal Majesty's proud Navy? My honour, not with me! Master at Arms, arrest this vile villain!",
"Hundreds of corrupt officials here, and I must meet the only righteous one.. Well, maybe your replacement will be more susceptible. Cause YOU will be sent home soon.. in a leadcoffin filled with rum!",
"Ah, thank you.. err.. in the name of the Crown! Now if that ain't a proof of your loyalty.. Such honest subjects deserve of course the support of every Naval official! Well, I just remember that the dock has become vacant this very morning and will not be occupied for a week. Put your ship in there, and I'll ask the Master Attendant to have it careened and overhauled. After the regular working hours, of course.",
"Ah Captain, you are from the East India man I saw in port. I am correct I trust?",
"Yes sir, correct as usual, here are my papers. I am in need of some repairs.",
"Yes, yes. Signed by Lord Beckett himself! Everything is in order. Get your ship to the drydock at the port. We will start work at once. I will charge the costs to the Admiralty's account.",
"Much obliged sir, much obliged. I will pass on a good word about you to his lordship.",
"Good day, ",
". What is your business here?",
"My ship has sustained some damage. I wish it to be repaired.",
"Certainly, #ssir#. If you will move your ship to our dock, I'll ask the Master Attendant to have her careened and overhauled. You'll only have to pay ",
"Thank you. I shall put my ship in the capable hands of your Master Attendant at once.",
"I am just looking around this port. Good day.",
"I am the Commissioner of the Naval Dockyard. The Navy Board despatched me to supervise the principal officers of the yard. Having a Naval dockyard here in the Caribbean is of vital importance cause without constant repair our Leeward Islands squadron would soon be immobilised by rot, Taredo worm and Hurricane damage.\nThis, of course, includes your ship. If she has been damaged by enemy action or by a storm, we can repair her to full battle readiness.",
