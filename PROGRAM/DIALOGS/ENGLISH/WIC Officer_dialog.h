". What brings you to my desk?",
"My name is ",
". There is a favour I would like to ask from you.",
"Wait, this is an office? I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. Goodbye.",
"Ask away. But please be brief. There is a lot more paperwork lying on my desk.",
"Paperwork? Yes, PAPERWORK! That is exactly what I need help with. I would like to avoid paying commission on the sale of my cargo.",
"Ah, that sounds like a good idea. That should also prevent your crew from wanting to sign articles with them and it is only a small step from there to piracy!",
"It appears we speak the same language! The more profit and the less pirates preying on merchant vessels, the better it is!",
"While of course I am quite happy to help a fellow merchant, you must understand that there are some... administrative costs involved. I can do as you ask, but it will cost you 1,000,000 gold pieces.",
"I imagine that price is so inflated as proof that I truly am serious about being a respectable merchant? That is understandable. It seems we have a deal.",
"Now that sounds like a lot of fun. How about I take my leave and let you to your own affairs? Thanks and goodbye.",
"Pirating merchant vessels? No, we would not be wanting that at all. Yet you have just given me a completely unrelated idea. I shall be leaving now...",
"Wait? What? How....? Piece of paper? Plenty gold??? I think I'll go visit the apothecary now.",
"There you go! Signed, stamped and all official. Be warned though that your licence will be immediately revoked upon the slightest unrespectable act.",
"Understood. I'm sure I'll enjoy my time as an honest merchant. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.",
" and I'm in charge here.",
"Paying commission on the sale of cargo? What are you, some sort of merchant? In case you haven't been paying attention, this here town now belongs to pirates, who just love to take cargo from merchants without paying any commission, or anything else!",
"Pirates? Arr, then I'll be off to do some pirating of my own!",
