"Never interrupt a Frenchman when he is drinking, you fool!",
"But I...",
"If someone hasn't cut off your ears, I'll do it myself!",
"Hey! Settle down!",
"What is it you want?!",
"My name is ",
".",
"Go to the Devil, you rude... Ach! Your name means nothing to me! Now go back to the stinking scuppers out of which you crawled, and leave me to drink in peace.",
"You must be Armand Delacroix, the incredibly charming pirate who stole the heart of a...certain señorita.",
"...Oh......Pardonnéz moi......You carry a letter, ",
"?",
"Ah, so now the snarling and obnoxious drunken lout is suddenly polite.",
"Watch your tongue, you......Alors, non, you have my token! Where did you... I do apologise, ",
". The drink, the sorrow, the worry, it all goes to my head and I become a despised beast. I am afraid it is a terrible burden I bear. My beautiful Mademoiselle Estrella must have sent you, oui?",
"Yes, Doña Estrella gave me this token, which is like the one you have strung around your neck. She said it would help identify you, and me to you. I suppose she thought you would kill me, otherwise.",
"Ah yes, and well I might have. I made these tokens for us while sitting here keeping this bench warm and drowning my woes. What message do you bear, #ssmarmy#? News of my fine fiery mademoiselle? Please sit, have a drink by my coin. (To the tavern-keeper)...Two rum for us here, Madamé Ines!",
"You are at least a gracious host, Captain Delacroix. Thank you.",
"...And the lady and I......Well... She has told you.",
"So you sit here and drink?",
"Ah, ",
", a man could do worse. I have done worse. Actually I sit trying to plan a bold move to rescue my beautiful love....The rum sets free the ideas.",
"I see. Is that why you've been here so long, drinking yourself into a pitiful stupor?",
"#sfriend#, you have a...delicate way with words....But yes... Mostly I sit and drink, and I water this table with my tears. I cannot figure a way to get her off that cursed island!",
"The Spanish navy is after you?",
"They are many, and I have but one ship, which I stole from those French imbeciles I used to serve. She is big and powerful but she takes a lot of men to sail. Sometimes I think I should sell her and get a fast little schooner, but ah, I cannot. The Voodoo Queen, she is a thing of beauty and power.",
"Sounds like you have two loves.",
"Mon Dieux, you are so right!",
"What do you want to do, Armand? Sail, or be with your lady?",
"Both, #ssmarmy#. Both. The Voodoo Queen has a cabin in which I could keep my lovely lady, and we could sail away to another archipelago, other islands. I could not make such a voyage in a smaller ship and keep my beautiful mademoiselle comfortable.",
"The lady gets seasick?",
"Alors, yes! She had been so ill on that Spanish pig of a galleon when I rescued her! The Voodoo Queen may be big, but she is stable and handles rough seas with ease. We need her to get clear of this archipelago in both safety AND comfort.",
"I see. Well, Armand, I probably should get back to my ship. Doña Estrella awaits my news that you still live.",
"Wait! ...Mon capitaine! YOU have a ship!",
"Delacroix, at the risk of a severe beating, you are VERY drunk!",
"Don't you see, it will be perfect! No one need know you are even there, ",
"! Ah, your exploits against those Spanish dogs will be sung to the rafters in taverns all across the world, ha HAAA!",
"You are very drunk, AND you are mad, Armand! Find someone foolish to help you. I may be many things, including drunk, but I am not a fool. No.",
"Mon capitaine......#ssmarmy#... I know I am heavy with drink, but I can see you are an honest #sgender#. I cannot trust these brigands all around us. I implore you... Please, help us.",
"Open up your ears, man! No!",
"Please. I will pay you handsomely! And I have a foolproof plan!",
"Armand, no. I cannot battle the Spanish navy for you.",
"Pshhht, a little timing, a little ruse, the Spanish can be fooled, #sfriend#! But only for a little while. Please, we need your help.",
"Armand...",
"But ",
", think of the lady! She is so beautiful, and so tragic! She lives without love. How could you not help the incomparable and exquisite Mademoiselle Estrella?",
"...Err, ahhhh you have me there, damn you! All right. I will help you.",
"For the last time, no. I am leaving now, Armand.",
"You are a prince among men, mon capitaine!",
"Noooo, just an idiot with a soft heart and a light purse. How much is 'handsomely', Armand?",
"Five thousand... Wait no, TEN thousand! There will be risks.",
"No kidding... Well what 'foolproof' plan has floated to the surface of your rum-soaked imagination?",
"Sail to #sisland_Isla Muelle# to Oyster Beach. Cross the island on foot, find my lady, wait until nightfall, and cross the island with her back to the bay. It is the only way to get her out.",
"Ah. Won't the guards object to her leaving town at night?",
"Hence the risks, capitaine ",
".",
"Hm. Perhaps a disguise would help.",
"Let us go for a walk, #sfriend#. I need to clear my head.",
"As do I. And I really should be getting back to my ship.",
"...Drink up, me hearties, yo ho! ...Heeeee, I am giddy with the thought that this will finally happen!",
"You are giddy with drink, Armand.",
"Ahhhh, that is true enough, #sfriend#. But my heart is lighter; I can now soar with the seabirds again! I don't know how to thank you!",
"Paying me would be good.",
"Ah oui, but I am not so drunk that I am a fool! I will pay you when we meet at the cove and you have my lovely lady ready to escape. Now be off to #sisland_Isla Muelle#, and I will be waiting at Oyster Beach in the Voodoo Queen.",
"Fair enough.",
"Smooth sailing and fair winds, mon capitaine.",
"And luck to you, Armand, in slipping past the Spanish navy. I'll see you on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"Mon Dieu, it is you, my beautiful Estrella? And such swordwork! No man would dare cross you, my bold and brave mademoiselle!",
"Armand, you will have time for this later, you should set sail while the seas are still clear of the Spanish!",
"Ah, you are right, ",
", #sfriend#. You have our deepest gratitude. We owe you more than just this reward. Look for a letter at the #sQuebradas Costillas# Inn on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#! Come, Estrella my sweet, let us fly!",
"Fair winds and following seas! And smooth sailing!",
"You are a queen among beggars, mon capitaine!",
