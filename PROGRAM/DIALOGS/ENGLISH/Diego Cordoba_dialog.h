"Si, #ssir#?",
"Are you an officer?",
"I am. What do you want?",
"Well, I'm a merchant and while I was sailing along the coast to visit this town to sell off my goods, I saw some men unloading goods at Bahia de Moa.",
"Might be some smugglers. I'll check it out. Thanks for your help.",
"It is my duty to assist the Spanish authorities.",
"Hey! What are you doing here? And where are those men you were talking about?",
"They don't exist. I made this story up to get you out here on your own, far from the city.",
"And why is that? I am an honest Spanish officer, so don't waste my time please. My patience has limits.",
"You will understand in a couple of moments. It seems that your governor is preparing some sort of action against the pirates at #sisland_Turks# and you are going to tell me exactly what and when.",
"I understand, alright. You are both a pirate AND a stupid #sgender#. Did you really think I would come here on my own? Guards! Kill this #sgender#!",
"Bad decision! You will regret that.",
"Stop! I surrender.",
"Ah. So you ARE reasonable after all! Now that you failed to get me killed, you will tell me what I want to know. Unless you want me to kill you. And I won't fail as you did. You can be sure of that.",
"Very well then. My governor is not happy with the pirates at #sisland_Turks# and he wants to capture the island to decrease the pirate threat to the Spanish convoys.",
"That sounds like a risky operation.",
"I know. But our governor is an ambitous person and if he succeeds, our King will reward him with the governorship of #sisland_Turks# as well.",
"A Spanish governor at the beautiful pirate island of #sisland_Turks#? That sounds horrible! When does the operation take place?",
"During the next couple of days. The governor will inform only the troops the day before leaving.",
"Ah. I'll need to hurry back to #sisland_Turks# then. And you are coming with me. I won't kill you, but I can't risk the governor finding out that the pirates of #sisland_Turks# are warned that he is coming. I'll let you go as soon as this situation is resolved.",
