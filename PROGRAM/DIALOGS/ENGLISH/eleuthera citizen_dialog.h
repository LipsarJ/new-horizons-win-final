"Alas, though our governor is really a good man, he lacks strong will. A more forceful governor would make our colony feel safer, and our merchants might trade in more profitable conditions. Besides that our fort needs repair.",
"I see. I've got another question, if you don't mind.",
"Thanks. Goodbye.",
"What can I say about him? He is little coward, and not so smart. Besides that he is very greedy! Though he always knows all the news.",
"I see. I've got another question, if you don't mind.",

"?",
"Tell me about the colony's history.",
"Are there other towns on this island?",
"Do you know anything about the fort that protects the town?",
"Let me ask you something else.",
"You've come all this way just to learn local history? Well, all right. The colony was founded 54 years ago.\nThey found rich mineral deposits on the island, and the town gradually grew. We're doing quite well these days.",
"Please, continue.",
"Indeed. Let me ask you something else.",
"It's never been exactly peaceful around here. This land remembers more than its share of battles.",
"I see. Can I ask you something else?",
"I've heard rumors that some nobleman bought a house in the jungle, and nobody's seen this house, nor seen this nobleman.",
"Tell me more.",
"The entire island is covered with thick jungle. The shores are rocky, and there are many reefs. However, we do also have another really small town on this Island, #sAlice#, I went there once, it was alright, I guess...",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"There's not much more to tell other than #sAlice# which really isn't a big town by any means. Jungle and rocks - just like all the other islands. Everything worthwhile is inside the town walls.",
"Continue...",
"I see. Let me ask you something else, if I may.",
"To be honest, captain, I don't know anything about the local fort.",
"Well, let me ask you another question, if you don't mind.",
"Our fort was built in more prosperous times, and they really did it right. Even now, it's a formidable structure, although it has been through a lot. The garrison is quite impressive, too - around 1500 men.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"I'm not sure we should be talking about the fort. What if you're a pirate, planning to attack it?",
"All right. Let's talk about something else, then.",
"I see. Let's try another subject, then.",
"Is there a blacksmith in this town?",
"No #ssir#, I apologize.",
"And another thing, #ssir2#.",
"Um, that's all, folk.",
"This blade of mine isn't fit for scraping pocks off a blind monkey's arse. Know anyone who could bring it up to snuff?",
"Sorry, no smith here...",
"Splendid. Tootloo.",
"And where is the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"We have a population of",
"citizens.",
"? Eh, he's a reclusive man. Don't know much about him...",
"Is there a somewhere I can borrow or save some money?",
"Yes, #susurer# is the local loanshark, but I'm told he's a decent chap.",
"That'll be all for now, thanks.",
"Ah, the tavern. Yes, you go upstairs and through the door out to the town.\nTurn around and you should be looking straight at the door to the tavern.",
"A wise guy, eh? Goodbye!",
