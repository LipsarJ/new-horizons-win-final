"What are you doing in here? I have never seen you before. Get out!",
"Don't worry, miss. I know what happened to you and I am not here to cause you any more harm.",
"Why ARE you here then? Are you working for the French authorities? I haven't explained what happened to an officer yet.",
"No, I'm not working for your governor. I am captain of a ship and I am looking for someone. I heard he was in the brothel, but now that it's closed, I've hit a dead end. Perhaps you have seen him. He is a navigator who arrived here today.",
"Why should I help you? I'm hurt. I don't feel like helping anyone. I need some help myself right now.",
"If you want, I can explain what happened to the governor.",
"Thank you. That would be great.",
"So please tell me what you know then.",
"A new guest, a stranger, arrived today. He seemed to be Spanish. I don't know if he's a navigator or if he is even a sailor, but he WAS dead drunk and ten minutes later in the bedroom he began to manhandle me. When my mistress heard me scream, she called the guards and they took him away to prison.",
"Thanks for your help. I'll talk to the man in prison and see if he is the person I'm looking for. And I will explain this to the governor as I promised, of course. Take a good rest and I hope you will quickly recover.",
