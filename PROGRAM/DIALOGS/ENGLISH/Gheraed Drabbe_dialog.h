"This won't take long. I've got a couple of questions about your last trip out.",
"All right, fine.",
"Then ask 'em quick and get out.",
"Word has it you saw a strange ship as you approached the island...",
"Yeah, that's right. A huge, black monstrosity with blood-red sails. Most of the men thought they were pirates.",
"They say there are pirates on your island - could that black ship belong to them?",
"Maybe. I have no idea. If you're so interested, go ask them yourself. I have a feeling I wouldn't have to worry about you disturbing my sleep ever again.",
"Thanks. I'll leave you alone now.",
