"Captain, wait a second!",
"What do you want? I can't stay here any longer.",
"Humm.. Sorry, but I heard your conversation and I was thinking you may need another officer for this expedition.",
"Well, it's my first participation in such an expedition, so maybe I could use an additional officer. Are you a good fighter?",
"Yes, I took part in few operations.",
"Really? I'm interested. What were these operations?",
"Humm.. Well.. Humm.. I wouldn't like to delay you. I could explain this later..",
"You're right. I should not waste any time now. Follow me, I accept you as my officer.",
"Thanks Captain! You won't be disappointed.",
"I should hope not.",
"WE HAVE TO GO! THE SOLDIERS ARE COMING!",
"What did you do! IDIOT!",
"Sorry Captain... I didn't think I would be detected...",
"Do you think I'm a complete idiot, I can't just forget what you did? I ordered you to stay near the warehouses watching our backs. And you, instead of doing your job, 'visited' the town. What happened inside your head?",
".........",
"Did you lose your tongue? I'm going to tell you what happened. You went in search of some gold or other valuable goods in the houses. Your greed has cost us all.",
"That's unfair! I only went to get some rum, took no time at all really.",
"SHUT UP, RUM... That's worse - you were seen! You deserve to be hung right now! ... But seeing that I'm FAIR, I will apply the pirates code for disobedience: the abandonment.",
"What! you want to leave me on THIS island... among the enemy?",
"And you should be happy. Normally, I would leave you on a deserted island with only a pistol and one shot.",
"Captain please! reconsider - it was only one rum!",
"You are totally unpredictable and a menace to the rest of the ships company! I will not go back on my decision.",
"So it's your last word. Alright, I swear I'll not forget what you did. You'll pay for leaving me here... and for taking my job - I don't know what Eugene saw in you.",
"Don't provoke me anymore. Now get out of my sight before I change my mind and kill you now.",
"Who is making such a racket?",
"I'm sorry, captain. Have we woken you up, hope you've said your good night prayers?",
"Very funny. What luck, I see my old 'friend' Peter has come to me. I might be looking for that BLOODY Pieter Boelen, but the Spanish will be quite happy when I bring you to #sHavana# as well. I have heard of your exploits saving your crew. The Spanish were not pleased at all.",
"You like dreaming, don't you? But we aren't here to listen to your ranting and raving. What we want is...",
"The ship, of course. Do you think I'll just step aside and let you sail away with MY ship?",
"If you want to live, yes.",
"You seem very confident. Are you still so skillfull with a sword?",
"Did you forget...?",
"Have you decided who of you will be fighting me yet? Or do you want ME to choose which of you will die first?",
"Haven't you ever heard the saying 'The only thing better than a Portuguese sword is a Portuguese swordsMAN'? Of all the pirates I must be one of the nicest. It takes a lot to make me mad. But my anger is terrible to behold. It is now unleashed on you!",
