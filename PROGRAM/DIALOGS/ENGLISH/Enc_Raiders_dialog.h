"What is it?",
"What do you mean?",
"Brigands! Well, crime must be punished. To arms!",
"I can't stomach common highwaymen, especially untidy ones. En garde!",
"I'll cut your heart out for your impudence!",
"Oh, #spronounsubj# doesn't get it! It's simple: You give us all your gold, and we let you live!",
"Haven't you heard of 'traveling expenses'? Well, that's us. Now part with your gold, or part with your head!",
"I'll translate for the stupid sailors: Give us all your money, matey! We love the doubloons and pieces of eight!",

"I won't surrender my gold without a fight!",
"Hey, don't get excited! I was just kidding. Go on, now!",
"In that case, we've changed our minds. You can go.",
"You're a brave #sgender#, so we'll let you go! But don't let us catch you again.",
"Well, so long, then!",
"You should quit this foul business. You're not very good at it. Goodbye!",
"You've made a wise decision. Goodbye!",
"It's too late to back out now - you've got an appointment with your maker!",

"What?! We'll have your guts for garters!",
"Try it!",
"All right! Give 'em to me, and you can go!",
"Well, today it's enough to buy you your life. You can go.",
"Let me give you some free advice - if you're such a easy mark, you shouldn't be wandering around the jungle! Stay in the port and drink your rum. You'll live longer.",
"Blast you all!",
"You look to me like a richer #sgender# than that. But that's okay. When we're finished with you, we'll turn you upside down and see what shakes out!",

"Spare me! I just modest robber! I am too young to die!",
"If you would sit at home - you would live longer!",
"Why do you waste your time and talents mugging pennyless travellers like me? You could earn much more gold by plundering fat merchantships. Join my privateer crew and you'll soon be swimming in the sea... eh.. in gold, I mean.",
"Bad luck for you, I've left all my money on my ship. You can get some of that, but only if you do me a favour in return: I desperately need planks for my ship, and I am willing to pay a premium price. Why don't you fell some of those trees for me? T'will be easier than felling me, cause trees hardly fight back.",
"Well, a cruise through the Caribbean would be a nice change from this feverinfested jungle. It's a deal, we'll join you, and I bet some of our.. eh.. colleagues will surely like to join as well.",
