"My name is ",
", and you can spare your hospitality. I'm here on business.",
"Welcome, #ssir#! What do you want?",
"I need some information, and I find the local innkeeper is usually the man to ask.",
"I'm looking to hire some sailors for my ship.",
"Point me to the patrons here who might be looking for a job. I need to add to my crew, and I don't mind if they're cutthroats.",
"Do you have a room? I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"Do you have a free bed in this hovel?",
"I don't have any business with you right now. Goodbye.",
"That's true. I hear most everything. What do you want to know?",
"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"I don't have any questions at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"Maybe they have. There are many rumors around.",
"Hurry. I'm a busy man.",
"It's a little too late in the day to find good sailors. They'll all be asleep or passed out by now. Come back in the morning - or you can spend the night here at the tavern.",
"All right. Do you have a room?",
"I don't need a room at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"I do have a vacancy. How long are you going to stay?",
"Overnight.",
"Just until dark.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"What - does that come with a personal staff? I'll pass.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"That's too much. I'll stay in the tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Dear visitors! Please stop this outrage! Don't force me to call the guards!",
"All right, all right! I'm already gone!",
"If he is they prefer to sail in with less satellites, you know this", 
"Yes, I forgot. Alright, I'll come back later, when I have fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've done caused too much trouble for my country",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You arrived just in time. A merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You should talk to him. There he is, just coming in to the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody like that at the moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm, then I will wait.",
"I'd like to buy a bottle to take with me.",
"How about a bottle of something to take back to the ship?",
"And have you wander around the streets drunk until you're arrested? I can't allow that! But you can rent a room, take the bottle upstairs and drink to your heart's content there.",
"What, is my hospitality not good enough for you? I'll tell you what - you can have a bottle, but you'll drink it upstairs. I'll even throw in a free meal.",
"That seems fair enough. What do you have?",
"No, that's not what I had in mind.",
"I can sell you a bottle of the finest wine for 330 gold pieces. Or how about this bottle of rum for 132 gold pieces - the good stuff, don't waste it by watering it down! Plus 5 gold pieces for the room.",
"Alright, that wine should be pleasant company for the night.",
"I'll have that rum, then.",
"Too expensive by far!",
"Has there been an English convoy here lately?",
"Yes, a few days ago. Some of the officers were in here, and by the looks of them they'd already done some drinking in the other tavern. They had a few more drinks, then headed for the hotel.",
"Thanks! I'll see if anyone at the hotel remembers them.",
"I've heard a rumour that the silver train is on its way here. Do you know anything about that?",
"Hush! Do not talk about the silver train here!\nDo you see that officer? If he suspects that you are taking an interest in the silver train, he will take an interest in you. When he takes an interest in people, they tend to 'disappear'.",
"Thanks for the warning.",
