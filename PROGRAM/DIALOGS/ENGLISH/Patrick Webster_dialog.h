"I'm just looking to plug up a couple of holes and patch my sails. No questions asked.",
"At the moment, I'm more interested in information.",
"No, I'm just killing time. I thought I might kill some of yours while I'm at it.",
"Well, if you're a captain, my shipyard is at your service.",
"Excellent, ",
". Let's have a look at my ship and see what needs fixing.",
"I appreciate it. At the moment, though, I'd just like to ask you some questions.",

"Not at the moment, no.",
"Is there anything else I can do for you, ",

"If you can slap a couple of patches on my tub, I'll be on my way!",

"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Allright, my dock beside the fort is available for you. If you want I'll tell my dockmaster to tow your ship in there. Only then can I survey the damage and tell you how much time and money it'll take.",
"DOCK BESIDE THE FORT?? Uhh... I just remember that I have... eeh... another pressing business I must attend to first. Goodbye.",
"After closing this dialog, press ENTER to bring up the sail changing interface.",
