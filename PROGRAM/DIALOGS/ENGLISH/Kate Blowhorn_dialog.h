".",
"You! I'd hoped you'd never darken my door again.",
"Good day, ",
".",
"Sorry about that, ",
"Do you want to see my goods?",
"Sure. Show me what you have in stock.",
"Not right now. Let's talk.",
"No, thanks. Maybe next time.",
"Are you looking to buy or sell?",
"I've got some goods I want to sell.",
"I'd like to buy some gear.",
"Neither, thanks. So long.",
"I'm all ears. What's on your mind?",
"I'm looking for work for my ship and crew.",
"I'm interested in a worker of yours, Clauss. I'd like to pay off his debt.",
"Pay for him? Sure, you can do that. He has worked off a part of his debt...",
"Enough. Just tell me how much money do I have to give you.",
"Let me check my papers...aha...yes.... Yes, here it is. Clauss owes me 2632 gold.",
"Hmm, the lad spent up a lot. Here's your money. Now tell me, where can I find Clauss?",
"I think I'll delay the payment a bit.",
"I've sent him to the tavern to get a keg of ale. You'll find him there.",
"Thanks.",
"I'm afraid I don't need your services just now.",

", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"I was asked to deliver some cargo to you.",
"Surely you must have some job you'd like done. I'd be happy to lend you my services for a fee.",
"I can't talk right now.",
"No, I won't be needing your services... at least, not as long as you're sinking #snation_desc# ships.",
"In that case, goodbye.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything for you at the moment.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"I'm sorry, but your ship lacks the capacity to handle the task I have in mind.",
"I'll come back later, then.",
"Oh! I was just going to ask you to do me a favour. The thing is, I need a cargo delivered to ",
", and as soon as possible. If you manage to do it in a month's time, you'll receive ",
" gold when you arrive. How do you like this offer?",
"I definitely like it.",
"I can't accept it.",
"I already told you today that I don't have anything for you.",
"Oh, sorry.",
"You've recalled your delivery a bit too late, don't you think? I'll take the goods anyway, but don't expect to be paid. Pay closer attention next time! Goodbye.",
"Farewell.",
"Oh! I've been waiting for it for a long time. Here is your reward, ",
"Always welcome.",
"I'm sorry. I have nothing for you now.",
"That's a pity. Perhaps you'll answer some questions, then.",
"Story of my life. How about some information, then?",
"Aye, #sladlass#. I'm expecting #squantity# cwt of #scargo#. Do you have it?",
"Umm... some of it appears to have been misplaced. Don't worry, I'll replace what was lost and bring it to you!",
