"What can I tell you? I just work here. You really want to talk to my boss. He's over there near the path leading into the island.",
"Thanks. I'll do that.",
"Ahoy there, captain. You are captain ",
"Yes I am. What can I do for you?",
"Captain Boelen tells me you are going after the French fleet. I have a very fast ship I have just captured that you might be interested in.",
"Really? You have very good timing, I might indeed be interested. [But not why you think].",
"I thought you would be. She is reputed to be the fastest ship in the Caribbean. I caught her being sailed by some landlubber. An easy catch, didn't have to fire a shot at her, just boarded her. So there's no damage.",
"I see. So can we go and see her?",
"Of course. She's down at the dock right now.",
"No time like the present. Let's go and look her over.",
"Well, there she is Captain. Bright as a button. I was thinking that about 200,000 in gold could make her yours. Free and clear.",
"She looks good alright, no argument there. But who is that youngster your man's guarding on the dock?",
"Oh! Him? He's the lubber who was trying to sail the ship. We'll have some fun with him later. Anyway, Captain what about the ship?",
"Well, it seems a fair price but I think we could do better.",
"Huh? Better? We? What do you mean?",
"Well Oswald, it's like this. I think that lad is the son of a nobleman, which means a fat ransom, which we would, of course, share.",
"Oh! And how would you propose we could do that? We couldn't get near any English port without a fleet of ships with us, without getting blasted out of the water. The lad told me his'self he stole the ship, so they will be looking for it.",
"Easy as sinking a cannon ball Oswald, easy as sinking a cannon ball. I sail with him to #sTortuga# and hand him over to a friend of mine there, who specialises in these matters. He gives us a hefty sum and he takes care of the ransom deal, adding his percentage of course. I sail back here and split it with you, less the cost for the ship that I owe you, and we both make a good profit.",
"Yea, wonderful. You must think I have a cannon ball for a brain. I give you the ship and you sail off into the sunset. Not on my watch matey. Think again.",
"No, no! Oswald, you're missing the point. It would be impossible for me and that young'un to sail that ship anywhere further than #sTortuga#. It couldn't be done, especially with the French fleet so near. And as you said yourself, we can't go near any English port.",
"Hmmm! I'm thinking... Wait a minute! Why don't I come with you? That way I can protect my investment.",
"Not quite Oswald. If I was to be tricking you, wouldn't I kill you when you fell asleep? Not a lot of protection of your investment there.",
"Ah! That's what I would do if I was trickin' you. No, that option is out. But how can I be sure you can be trusted?",
"That's easy. Word will soon get out when the youngster is returned to his father. You know how they love to shout about getting someone back from the pirates. So if you hear that, and I haven't come back, then you know you need to come after me. If you hear nothing then you know I'm still working on the deal.",
"Yes! That will work, because it's the English talking about it, that will tell me you've skipped port. I don't have to hear it from you, and you can't get round it. Yes, yes! I'm smarter than I think. How long do you reckon you'll be then?",
"Oh! It could take a month or two, as I may have to wait for my contact to return to #sTortuga#. Then say two or three days to sail back here.",
"Good, a bit longer than I'd hoped though, so set sail as soon as you can. I will wait here for your return with our money. It's been a good days business.",
"Yes, no problem, we'll go now. I do like it when everybody wins. Goodbye.",
