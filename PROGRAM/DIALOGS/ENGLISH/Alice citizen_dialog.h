"Please, continue.",
"Indeed. Let me ask you something else.",
"It's never been exactly peaceful around here. This land remembers more than its share of battles.",

"I've heard rumors that some nobleman bought a house in the jungle, and nobody's seen this house, nor seen this nobleman.",
"Tell me more.",
"The entire island is covered with thick jungle. The shores are rocky, and there are many reefs. However, we do also have another town, #sEleuthera#, it's quite a bit larger and it has a fort.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"There's not much more to tell other than #sEleuthera# which really is the main hub of the island. Jungle and rocks - just like all the other islands. Everything worthwhile is inside the town walls.",

"To be honest, captain, the only fort on the island is in #sEleuthera#.",
"Well, let me ask you another question, if you don't mind.",
"Ha-Ha! We have no fort here.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"I'm not sure we should be talking any forts. What if you're a pirate, planning to attack it?",
"All right. Let's talk about something else, then.",
"I see. Let's try another subject, then.",
"Is there a banker in this town?",
"Why yes, that would be #susurer#, nice guy as far as I know.",
