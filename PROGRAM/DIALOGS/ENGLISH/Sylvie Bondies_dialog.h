"What are you doing in my house, ",
"?",
"Don't worry, I am already leaving.",
"That's no business of yours, old hag. If you say one more word, you'll regret that you came into the world. Though actually...I don't want to soil my hands or my sword with you so I'll leave.",
"Hello stranger, to what do I owe the pleasure of welcoming you to my humble abode?",
". ",
"Sabine Matton",
" under my protection. She likes to blather more than any other person I know. Are you her godmother?",
"I understand you are ",
" and ",
"Sabine Matton",
" whom I have brought here is your god-daughter?",
"I have the misfortune to have ", 
"You know, I think that there is something wrong. ",
"Sabine Matton",
" your god-daughter thinks I am bringing her to you for her father, but I have different ideas.",
"Shut up, you, old hag. ",
"Sabine Matton",
" your god-daughter is under my 'protection' and it will be me that decides what to do with her.",
"What happened to my god-daughter?! What did you do with her?!",
"Don't worry so much. Your daughter is on my ship, and she is all right.",
"Just shut up. Don't annoy me with your snivelling. The girl is alive, but it's my business what I do with her.",
"Ah, I begin to understand. What do you demand for her release? Money I suppose?!",
"You are quite perceptive. I really want paying to release her.",
"You are quite right, of course. The jingle of gold coins has always been music to my ears.",
"Oh, I am sorry! It's good that you reminded me! I wanted to be shot of her as soon as possible.",
"That ",
"Sabine Matton",
" has bored me to death with her ceaseless prattle about the waves and sky . Take the girl, and good riddance.",
"The girl stays with me so I really don't have anything to talk about with you.",
"You must calm down, since I am going to keep the girl with me for now, later we'll see.",
"How much do you want, you rogue to set my girl free?!",
"How much can you offer, Madame?",
"How much is she worth to you? Tell me your price, and then we'll see.",
"I would give you all I have - 2000 gold.",
"You've got a deal. Give me the money, and I'll set my ‘passenger' free.",
"Ah, you are pretty shrewd too and drive a hard bargain. Well, give me the gold and I'll let the girl go.",
"Fine, I think I'll take the money but ",
"Sabine Matton",
" will stay with me, too.",
"Ha! All I have to do is take your money, and keep the girl with me!",
"Here is your gold, and I hope you choke on it!",
"Goodness, how rude! Still, I keep my word here is your god-daughter. Goodbye.",
"You are not the first one to wish me that fate. So just give me your money, here is your girl.",
"No, you can't do this to us! Please no ",
", take pity on us!",
"Don't worry so much, or you may spoil your digestion.... Give me your money, and bid me goodbye.",
"Why not? You can't stop me. And if you take it into your head to call for the guard, then it will go very hard for your god-daughter.",
"Take your money and go. You are not honourable Captain, you are a monster!",
"Good bye, Madame.",
"Oh, please quit your squawking.",
"Oh, you are so kind, ",
"! I see that you've got a kind heart, although you play the part of the cruel pirate.",
"You are quite wrong, dear. I am just desperately tired of your god-daughter and her soppy dreaming. How long can anyone stand to sail cooped up with such a girl?",
"You don't understand at all, old woman. Your daughter just wore me out with all her daydreaming now the slight pleasure I could derive from her company can't compare with the endless annoyance she causes me.",
"I am afraid that you are mistaken, Madame. I am an opportunist...",
"Don't think better of people than they merit. I use any situation to my advantage",
"I see now that I actually was too kind to you. You are a genuine black hearted rogue!",
"I am gratified that you finally esteem me for my true worth, but I really do have other engagements, so I'll have to cut this conversation short.",
"I am well accustomed to such words...but if you don't want anything to happen to you or your girl, I suggest you keep them to yourself!",
"I don't care what you think. I am not an impressionable young woman, and I can see through to the truth.",
"As you wish, Madame, but now let me take my leave of you.",
"Well, I'm happy you think you can see the truth, old woman, but either way I really must go.",
"Why? What are you to do with her?",
"Don't worry. I'll keep your god-daughter nice and safe.",
"Easy, now. I am the one who decides what to do with the girl, and trust me, I'll find a use for her.",
"Well, ",
", probably ",
"Sabine Matton",
" didn't know about her father's true intentions. She may even be better off with you. ",
"Thanks for the grudging admission...and now I must take my leave of you.",
"Actually I was supposed to bring your god-daughter to you...so if you have a place for her, here she is, and let me take my leave of you.",
"I wish you a fair wind, ",
"!",
"Farewell.",
"What?! How dare you to say such things! You are a blackhearted villain, ",
"!",
"I am not going to listen to your insults. I am going to return to my ship and keep the girl onboard. If you try to stop me or hinder me then, I swear to God I'll cut your throat!",
"No, not my girl, please, let her go!",
"Not a chance, old woman.",
"Yes. And I am very grateful to you for what you've done for us.",
"Never mind. By the way ",
"Arnaud Matton",
" asked me to give you this letter.",
"Thanks, I leave fair recompense to your judgment. If you have a little gold to spare, I wouldn't say no and, by the way, I have a letter for you.",
"Thank you once again. Wait a second! I'll dash off a couple of lines to ",
"Arnaud Matton",
", and if it's not too much trouble, please deliver this letter when you next see him.",
"Goodbye. I hope everything goes well with you.",
"Farewell.",
"Certainly, certainly! Here is all I can spare. There's 800 gold there, and I only hope it will be enough to cover your expenses.",
"Oh. Yes. Yes, indeed. ",
"Why are you in my house? I have nothing more to say to you."
