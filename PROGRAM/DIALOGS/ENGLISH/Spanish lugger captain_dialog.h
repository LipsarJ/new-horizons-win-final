"Yes.",
"Oh, thank Heaven we have found you in time, ",
"! You might have fallen foul of our ship 'Natividad' before I could bring you the wonderful news!",
"News?",
"#srank#, I welcome you as the new ally of Spain! For weeks now, your country and mine have been brothers in arms against Napoleon. Together, with God's help, we shall destroy him!",
"...",
"Oh, perhaps you think it is too good to be true! Here is a letter from your Admiralty.",
"Er... thank you. Er... excuse me. Mr. Bush!",
"Last month, Napoleon kidnapped our king and put his own brother on the throne of Spain. Our government in exile immediately concluded an alliance with His Britannic Majesty. You understand now my fear that you might have encountered the 'Natividad'. Her Capitán is also ignorant of the new alliance.",
"It... er... happens, sir, that last week we did encounter the 'Natividad'.",
"Ha ha ha! You were wise to show your heels, ",
". She is twice your strength. Ho ho, imagine what would have happened! Madre de Dios!",
"We... er... captured the 'Natividad', Señor.",
"Que? Oh, ho ho ho! Impossible! You are joking!",
"I've never been more serious in my life.",
"Oh Capitán, Capitán, it can not be true! You - you gave the 'Natividad' to the rebel Don Julian? But a week ago you were already our allies! Santa Maria! Do you realise what you have done? We have no other ship near #sisland_Cuba#! They will burn our ports, sack all our cities!",
"I am well aware of the situation.",
"#sname#! ... If I am to overtake 'Natividad' I must ask you to leave at once. Adios, Señores. Mr. Bush, will you show these gentlemen over the side?",
