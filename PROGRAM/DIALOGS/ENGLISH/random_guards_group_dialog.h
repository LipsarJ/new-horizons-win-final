"Your name is ",
", right? You look very familiar. Did we meet before?",
"I don't think so. But I should be going now.",
"I won't be long. Just long enough to ask you a quick question.",
"And what question would that be?",
"You see, I want to take the young lady there to a nice seaside picknick if you catch my drift. I thought you might know at what hour to do this best.",
"Ah, I see! Good luck with that, #slad#; I never even got a kiss from her. I suggest you go ",
"HALT! You #ssir#, Captain ",
", are under arrest for being a",
"Aren't you supposed to be off duty!?",
" spy!",
", are under arrest for piracy!",
". That would be the best time to have some privacy, I think. ",
"Thank you very much. I will tell her of your good deeds. Perhaps it may be of some profit to you also.",
"Do you think I'm stupid? That girl will never go with you. Go away now before I forget I'm on break and arrest you!",
"Wait! Maybe we can arrange something else? Could I buy you something to drink?",
"You should consider joining the navy.",
"I will think about it.",
"Leave me alone, I'm off duty.",
"Oh, don't worry about me.",
"Well... If you truly want this information you could pay me, say, ",
" to 'accidentally' spill the beans and forget this meeting ever happened.",
"That sounds like a fair deal to me.",
"You know what? I'll buy you a drink and you just forget this ever happened. How's that?",
"What happened? Like I said, just leave me alone!",
"Your best chance is ",
". There shouldn't be many guards at that time. ",
"Thank you very much. I shall bother you no more.",
"You look like the kind of guy who likes to bet. I want to know when the beach will be empty. I've got plenty of gold to offer.",
"I'm up for a bet if you wager ",
"Okay, you're on!",
"Sorry, I have changed my mind.",
" enemy!",
"You don't know me, but I'm a friend of Holland. And just to show that friendship, why don't you share a bottle of the good stuff with me?",
"Hold on! We may be enemies while we're on duty, but today I'm here on entirely peaceful, lawful business. What say we share a bottle of the best the house has to offer and swap stories?",
"Well, if you're going to be that generous...",
"That's the spirit! Talking of spirit... Hey, bartender! Bring us a bottle of your best rum! And give me the keys to the room, I don't want our party being spoiled by random drunks.",
"Is that any way to speak to a superior officer?",
"Are you blind? Are you an idiot? Or do you really want to spend the rest of the year cleaning out the latrines?",
"Sorry, sir. I mistook you for someone else.",
"No, I'm not blind, and you just added 'impersonating a Dutch officer' to your list of crimes.",
"Good, now add 'resisting arrest'!",
"That's better. Now, I need you for a special mission. Follow me.", 
"Ah, that explains why I've never been able to get even a kiss from her. Good luck, lass. I suggest you go ",
"The governor obviously doesn't care, so patrols are few and far between. ",
"Patrols are as usual. ",
"Security is tight, so good luck. ",
"The gov's been putting every man on coast guard duty lately, but it's your neck if you go there anyway. ",
"I dropped a memento of my late lover on the beach, but I'm deathly afraid of being taken for a smuggler and brought to the gallows. I can tell you are a kind, gentle soul. Please, would you tell me when it is safe?",
"#snpcsir#, I have a proposition I am sure you will appreciate. There is a substantial treasure buried on the shore. I don't want to be seen digging it up, as I'm sure you understand. I will share half with you if you tell me when it's safe.",
"Those smugglers sure have it rough here, I bet there's not a single hole in the patrols.",
"I love watching the sea turtles on the shore, but they're always scared off nowadays, what with all the coast guard patrols.",
"That's terrible! You should try #spatroltime#, the shores should be empty then. Best of luck, #slad#! ",
"*He glances over his shoulder and leans in towards you conspiratorially* Try #spatroltime#. *He winks* ",
"You'd think, but #spatroltime# the shores are entirely empty. ",
"I know what you mean, friend! If I were you, I'd try #spatroltime#. The beaches should be empty for you to watch the turtles in peace. ",
"The gov's been putting every man on coast guard duty lately, so be careful. ",
"The gov's been putting every man on coast guard duty lately however, so they'd have to be real good or real stupid to try it. ",
"Security is tight, so they'd have to be precise. ",
"Thank you, #snpcsir#, you don't know what this means to me!",
"*You wink back and theatrically turn and leave*",
"Hah, nothing is perfect it seems! As long as the smugglers don't find out it shouldn't be a problem. Well, got to go! ",
"Thank you for the tip, I'm glad I found a fellow turtle enthusiast! Stay safe! ",
"Tough luck. Do you think I'm so stupid as to just tell you the patrol schedule? Get out before I forget I'm off duty and arrest you! ",
"Do I look like a sucker to you? Get lost before I take an extra shift right here and now and drag you to jail! ",
"You're right. ",
"Sea turtles? Do I look like that much of a sucker? You better go bother someone else before I get real annoyed. ",
"Are you looking for trouble? Get lost, #sdiminutive#!",
