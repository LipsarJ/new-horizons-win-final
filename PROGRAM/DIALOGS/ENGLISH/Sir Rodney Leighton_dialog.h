"Good day, sir. Nothing to report, sir.",
"Who are you?",
"I am ",
", sir.",
"Ah, ",
", it is good to see you again.",
"Congratulations on your promotion to ",
"Thank you, sir.",
"Why are you still here? You know your duty - be about it!",
"Er, yes, sir.",
"I have orders for you. You are to take a consignment of muskets and ammunition, and deliver them to a rebel named ",
". He has taken over the fort at Playa de Sabana.",
"I am familiar with that fort, sir. We blew it up to prevent a bunch of rebels from taking it over. If I may ask, sir, why are we helping them now?",
" is fighting against the Spanish, who are our enemies. The old adage 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' applies. Apparently ",
" has repaired the fort. And I would advise you not to mention your part in its destruction. He is known to be a man of a violent temper.",
"If I may ask, sir, why are we helping a bunch of rebels?",
" is fighting against the Spanish, who are our enemies. The old adage 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' applies. But be careful when dealing with ",
" as he is known to be a man of a violent temper.",
"I see, sir. Hopefully that temper will be vented on the Spanish.",
"That is the general idea, yes. Now, the weapons are already being loaded onto your ship. Finish provisioning her, then sail to Playa de Sabana as soon as possible.",
"Yes, sir.",
"That is the general idea, yes. But I am informed that your ship is already heavily laden. Clear out some space in your hold, then return here. I will then order the ammunition to be loaded aboard the ",
"Yes sir. I shall go to the store now.",
"You still do not have enough space required for the powder you are to take. Clear more space, ",
"Very good, ",
". I have already given orders for the ammunition to be transferred to the ",
". You are to leave for Playa de Sabana as soon as possible.",
"Very good, sir. I shall set sail for Playa de Sabana as soon as I am aboard the ",
"Now, the French have sent a squadron of four ships of the line to #sisland_Hispaniola#. They will probably anchor at #sPort au Prince#.\nYou will join my squadron. We shall blockade #sPort au Prince# and bottle the French force up in harbour.",
"Beg pardon, sir, but what if the French squadron anchors at #sSanto Domingo# instead?",
"Hmm. What do you suggest, ",
"Perhaps I could take the ",
" to #sSanto Domingo# to see whether the French are there.",
"Indeed. I have read about your career, ",
". Very prone to taking individual action. After the prize money for yourself, what?",
"Certainly not, sir!",
"Hmm. Very well. When we approach #sisland_Hispaniola#, you are to detach from my squadron. You will proceed to #sSanto Domingo# and ascertain whether the French ships are there.\nIf they are, you are to join me at #sPort au Prince#. We will then blockade #sSanto Domingo# instead.\nUnder no circumstances are you to engage the French fleet by yourself. Is that understood, ",
"Understood, sir.",
" at your service, sir.",
"Lady Barbara Wellesley is aboard, is she not?",
"She's been informed of your arrival, sir.",
"Your exploits at sea, ",
", have made you quite famous. As a matter of fact, when you make your report to Naval HQ, you'll probably find that you have something better to command than this little ",
"-gunner.",
"I did little to deserve it, sir.",
"Of course, it's my personal belief that you were very fortunate to defeat the 'Natividad', having first given her away, as you did, on your own initiative.",
"It seemed the best thing to do at the time, sir.",
"The captain of a frigate doesn't normally decide Admiralty policy.",
"There was no way of consulting the Admiralty, or I would have done so.",
"But really, Hornblower - giving away a 60 gun prize to a madman!",
"I stood ready to answer for my actions, sir.",
"Had you been serving under my command, you'd have answered for it alright! A court martial might have considered your action irresponsible.\nIn addition, it caused you to risk the life of the Duke of Wellington's sister.",
"I apologise for that, sir.",
"It would have gone very hard for you, ",
", if anything had happened to her. I too value Lady Barbara highly. We're to be married.",
"Yes, so Lady Barbara has told me, sir.",
"I suppose a ship of this size is rather confining, and confidences are likely to be freer than under normal circumstances.",
"Here you are, at last, my dear. You've no idea how concerned I've been for your welfare.",
"Shall we go? Your family waits impatiently for you in London, and after that, my family in Ireland.",
"Captain ",
", we have been at sea for over a month now",
", and yet we still do not appear to be near #sisland_Saint Martin#. Having been told that you are a good navigator and familiar with these waters, we can assume that this is no accident. Have you anything to say for yourself?",
"I have no excuse, sir.",
"Admiral Pellew gave me secret orders, sir.",
"Lying will not help you, Hornblower. I might have believed that if you had asked to detach from the squadron to follow these supposed orders by yourself. More likely, since it is I who command this squadron, Sir Edward Pellew would at least have had the courtesy to inform me that you were under orders, even if they were so secret that he kept the details from me.",
"I have nothing more to say, sir.",
"Then it seems to me that at best you have been using His Majesty's ships to pursue your own objectives, which is mutiny; or you have deliberately delayed our voyage in order to permit the French to enter the Caribbean unhindered, which is high treason. A court martial will determine your exact charge, but for you it makes no difference.\nThe penalty for both is hanging. The sentence will be carried out forthwith.",
"Well, gentlemen, now that we are finally all assembled, I have some fairly startling news that has just been sent to me by cutter. The French have broken McCartney's blockade at #sMarigot#. The old boy supposedly had Napoleon's ships bottled up in there. A pea soup fog settled in for 48 hours. When it lifted, four ships of the line had slipped away.",
"Any idea what course they took, sir?",
"The only place they could go is to #sisland_Hispaniola#. So, if we proceed from our position here, we'll intercept them on their way to #sPort au Prince#. Four against four, the outcome is obvious.",
"Ahem...hem...",
"You don't seem to agree, Captain ",
". May I ask where else they would go except to #sPort au Prince#?",
"I submit sir, to #sSanto Domingo#.",
"The south end of #sisland_Hispaniola#? Nonsense! Why should they? From #sPort au Prince# they can strike back at the rebels on #sisland_Cuba#.",
"But if I were the French commander, sir, I'd consider the possibility of a strike against #sisland_Redmond#.",
"The French would never risk four ships in a wild gamble against the fort of #sRedmond#.",
"They might, if they could knock out our nearest base to #sisland_Cuba# before attacking that island. I submit most urgently, sir, that instead of concentrating on #sPort au Prince#, we move along the south coast of #sisland_Hispaniola#.",
"There'd be the devil to pay with the Admiralty if the French went north instead and got to #sPort au Prince# uninterrupted.",
"There might be the devil to pay if they attack #sRedmond#.",
"Perhaps we could take care of both possibilities with a wide deployment. Three of us concentrating on the northern approach to #sPort au Prince# and one ship inshore covering the south.",
"Good idea, ",
"! You see, I've no objection to a practical suggestion. I welcome it, in fact. We've a war to win.\nVery well, then, who goes south inshore? Which of our ships has the shallowest draught?",
"The 'Sutherland', sir. French built.",
"Oh, I see now what was influencing you, ",
". The prospect of picking up a prize or two, eh?",
"Not at all, sir!",
"Well, I'll make sure of that. I know how you enjoy acting on your own initiative. I'm ordering you not to risk your ship in any way, for any reason. I want nothing crack-brained. If you sight the enemy ships, you'll bring the news to me, and we'll destroy them together. Is that clear?",
"Perfectly clear, sir.",
"Just the same, put it in writing.",
