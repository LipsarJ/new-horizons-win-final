"No, I just thought I'd stop by.",
"Well, I'm very pleased to meet you. If you are a captain, then my shipyard is always at your service.",

"Very well.",
"All right, my dock beside the fort is available for you. If you want, I'll tell my dockmaster to tow your ship in there. Only then can I survey the damage and tell you how much time and money it'll take. ",
"DOCK BESIDE THE FORT?? Uhh... I just remember that I have... eeh... another pressing business I must attend to first. Goodbye.",
