"If you want to order a drink - talk to the owner. He is standing at the bar.",
"Thanks for the advice.",
"Excuse me, but I overheard you talking about the silver train.",
"Apparently that sort of talk brings trouble. So, pretending for the moment that you heard correctly, what do you want?",
"Nothing in particular. But if you buy a bottle of wine, Salvadore there will want you to take it upstairs. And if you do that, I'll join you.",
"Alright, I could do with a bottle of wine. Especially with the right company.",
"We can talk privately here. If you want to talk about the silver train, it is safe.",
"Alright. What do you know of the silver train?",
"Not much, other than that once it is in town, you will never get it. It will be moved under heavy guard to boats which will take it to the fort.\n#sCartagena# fort is hard to attack at the best of times, and when the treasure fleet is moored next to it, that is not the best of times!",
"So you're saying that the silver train can't be attacked in town or in the fort.",
"That is right. The only way you will have a chance is in the jungle. The people who know the jungle best are the local Indians. And they're the people I want to help.",
"Why do they need help, and how does this lead me to the silver train?",
"Their village is suffering from disease. They can not afford to buy medicine and nobody will give it to them for free.\nIf you are willing to bring a large enough cargo of medicine to the nearby beach, I will set up a meeting so that you can give it to the Indians. I'm sure I can persuade them to guide you to the silver train in exchange.",
"How much of a cargo do you mean?",
"The more the better, but at least 100 crates.",
"That's a lot!",
"It is expensive here, but perhaps cheaper if you buy it at another colony and bring it here. And you will need the space if you are to take all that silver!",
"True. Very well, I'll get the medicine.",
"When you have it, talk to me again. Don't mention the silver train. ",
"Say that you think I'd look better in a blue dress. I'll take that as a signal that you are ready to give medicine to the Indians.",
"A blue dress, eh? Now you mention it, that might look quite good. But I'll not mention it again until I have your medicine.",
"It's their lucky day, then! I just happen to have a load of medicines with me.",
"Oh, good! Wait a couple of days, then sail to the beach. I'll talk to my friends and arrange for some of the Indians to meet you there.",
"Very well, I can find ways to pass the next two days.",
"I don't have enough cargo space for that much medicine.",
"Then you won't be able to take the silver from the silver train, will you?  You won't be able to put it in your pocket!",
"Good point. I'll try again when I have a bigger ship.",
"If you do manage to get a larger ship, or make space for the medicine, talk to me again. Don't mention the silver train. ",
"I'd be glad to have a chat with you if I weren't so busy. A good day for the tavern isn't always a good day for talking!",
"I'll let you get back to work, then. But I must say, you'd look nicer if that dress was blue.",
"...",
"It's kind of you to say that. Why not rent a room for the night? I'll join you when I have time.",
"I'll be waiting for you!",
"Hello again! Do you have the medicine for the Indian village?",
"Yes. 100 crates, just as you asked.",
"Umm... no.",
"What? But I trusted you! That is not a mistake which I shall make again!",
"Sorry, but other business comes first. Goodbye.",
"You again! I don't want to talk to you any more!",
"I'm not worried. There are other taverns with friendlier staff.",
