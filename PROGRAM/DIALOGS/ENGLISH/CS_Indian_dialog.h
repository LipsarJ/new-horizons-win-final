", what brings you to our tribe?",
"I'm just exploring.",
"Greetings. We were told that someone would bring us medicine. Is that you?",
"It was, but I do not have enough medicine.",
"It was, but I have no medicine.",
"First, you will lead me to where I can attack the Spanish. When I return here with the silver, we'll unload the medicine at the same time as we load the silver.",
"Then my people will have to find another way to get medicine. And you will not find the Spanish silver.",
"Goodbye.",
"That is not what was agreed.",
"I was not the one who made the agreement. My deal is, you get the medicine when I get the silver. Take it or leave it.",
"Though I do not trust you, our village will perish without the medicine so I have no choice. I will lead you to where you will fight the Spanish. Follow me.",
"Yes. I have the medicine you need. In exchange, you are to lead me to where I can attack the Spanish and their silver.",
"That is what we were told also. If you unload the medicine, the others here will take it to our village. And I will take you to where you will fight the Spanish.",
"Agreed. We shall begin unloading immediately.",
"Thank you for bringing us medicine. Now our village will live. The others are taking the medicine there now. And I will honour the agreement. Follow me.",
"Alright, let's go.",
"Rest a while! Do not move around.",
"What happened?",
"You have been bitten by a particularly nasty type of snake. I have been able to revive you, but not yet to fully heal you.",
" Your antidote will not help you.",
"\nBut I can heal you by combining our own remedies with the medicine you bring to our village. If you will order the medicine to be brought here, I can begin.",
"Very well.",
"I do not have any medicine.",
"I only have ",
" units of medicine.",
"Without the medicine, we will soon die of disease.",
" And your treachery has doomed you as well. Truly our gods are just.",
"...",
"That is not enough to save our village from the disease.",
"That is not enough to save all of us, but the village will live.\n",
"It is also not the amount which was promised, but you will live. However, we are no longer bound to help you against the Spanish.",
"However, if you give me ",
" in gold, I can give it to our friends in town and they can buy more medicine to save our whole village.",
"Alright, I can afford that. Here is the money.",
"That is too much!",
"I do not have that much money.",
"Then, provided you give us what medicine you have, I will heal you. But we are no longer bound to help you against the Spanish.",
"Thank you for sparing some medicine to save me.",
"\nBut by combining our own remedies with the medicine you brought to our village, I can heal you. By saving us, you have saved yourself. Truly our gods are just.",
"I shall send one of our people into town with this money to meet our friends. For now, you will send what medicine you have, and I will heal you.",
"I shall lead you back to the jungle. From there you should be able to find your way back to your ship.",
"Good, let's go.",
"This is where I leave you. You will not be able to find our village again, so do not try.",
"Thank you for bringing me this far. Goodbye.",
"You have recovered well. There is still time for you to go to meet the Spanish. I will now take you there.",
"Thank you. Lead on!",
"This is where I leave you. For bringing us the medicine we need, you will always be welcome if you return to our village.",
"Thank you. I may very well visit your village again. Goodbye.",
"Where is the medicine? I do not see your ship.",
"It's moored somewhere else. I shall bring the ship here. Goodbye for now.",
