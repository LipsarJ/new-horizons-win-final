"Dom Guillermo, welcome to my office.",
"I note you didn't forget me since our meeting in the Governor's party.",
"Of course, how could forget the envoy of our King. Can I help you?",
"Yes, during my visit in the San Felipe fort, Governor Montavez revealed a secret.",
"What exactly?",
"There would have a tunnel connecting your office to the fort.",
"That's true. The entrance is at the bottom of these stairs.",
"Interesting.",
"Thanks to it, if necessary, I can send more troops to the fort without being in danger by enemy ships shooting to the Port.",
"Wonderful! What a fantastic idea. Can you show me the tunnel.",
"I'm sorry, Dom Guillermo. As maybe you've already seen, the entrance is locked by an iron gate and only Governor Montavez has the key.",
"[Thinks: Not Good!] I understand, Admiral. That's not important, it was just for curiosity. Well, you must have a lot of work since your come back in Cartagena so I prefer to let you alone.",
"Thank you, Dom Guillermo. It's true the expedition on Curacao has delayed my work here but everything will be settled in a few days.",
"Good to hear. See you Admiral!",
