"Word goes you are looking for a good captain.",
"Ah my dear captain, indeed I am. You see, the work I'm doing here sometimes raises eyebrows at the church. And it seems I made them angry again by experimenting with the blood of some deceased people. Normally I just donate some money to the church and they look away but I don't have the money any more now to please them. So could I ask you to donate a sum of 1000 coins to them?",
"I would love to help you Steven. But I don't see what good this would do; apart from parting me with my money, that is.",
"Well captain, see it as an investment. The job I was talking about concerns a new medicine. I need some supplies for that which I can't get myself. If you can get those for me, I will gladly give you some of this medicine in return for your support. But first I need to get on good grounds with the church again, else they might throw me out of town.",
"You've convinced me, Steven. I will go there right away to make a donation for you.",
"I'm sorry Steven, I can't help you.",
"Thank you very much, captain! As soon as you've done that, please return to me and we can talk business.",
"I'll be back before you know it!",
"I understand... I hope you change your mind.",
"We'll see.",
"What where you doing at that heretics place?",
"Wait... what?",
"We saw you leaving that place of the devil! We are on our way now to make him leave this town forever!",
"Okay, I have no business with him.",
"Wait! He wanted me to make a donation for him to support the good deeds of the church. Would the devil do that?",
"I won't stand for this! En garde!",
"Thank you, my son. Now please move out of the way and let us do our job.",
"Go ahead.",
"Hmmm... I guess you're right. He is indeed a good man and does a lot for our community as well.",
"Yes, he does! Let him stay here and I'm sure he'll be able to do even more good!",
"Sinner!",
"...",
"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?!",
"These people wanted to get rid of you. I just fixed your problem, that's what I've done!",
"You haven't fixed anything. Do you really think they will stop at this? You've left me no other choice. I must leave here now.",
"But, but ...",
"I asked you to help me. You now see why, don't you? Well, you did do me a little favour, so I suppose I can teach you one trick before I leave. You may want to do that yourself as well.",
"Bye.",
"I have changed my mind about that donation of yours.",
"I've donated a nice sum of money for you. That should keep them off your back again for a while. Shall we talk business now?",
"Indeed we shall, my friend. Thanks for helping me out. Now let me teach you a little trick that may help you out in the future.",
"You're very welcome. Now what is this job you were talking about earlier?",
"I have heard stories about a very special plant which is said to grow on the mainland. It seems the natives use it for all kinds of treatments, so I want to get my hands on some myself. It is said that, when used properly, you will see the world in a different light and it will allow you to do things you couldn't do before.",
"That sounds like a very special plant indeed. But where do I come in?",
"The stories say that this plant is only to be used by the natives. According to their religion, nobody is allowed to touch this this magical plant before it has been prepared. I need someone to convince them to give some to me.",
"Ah, I see. But if it is so important, why don't you go yourself?",
"Believe me, I tried. They rejected my many offers. They even threatend to kill me if I wouldn't stop asking and I had to flee. But I believe that you might be able to convice them for me.",
"I've dealt with worse people already. I do reckon I will be able to convince them for you, my friend.",
"Hey, you didn't tell me this was going to be dangerous! I think I'll pass. Sorry, mate.",
"I'm very sorry to hear that, captain. Are you sure? The task will go to someone else then. Along with the potential rewards.",
"Yes Steven, I know for sure.",
"Did you say 'rewards'? Let me reconsider.",
"So you will help me?",
"Ah captain, there you are! It seems like the ship is being watched by some odd people. We tried to scare them off, but they didn't want to go. The guards were no help either. Apparently they are allowed to be there if they want to be.",
"Thanks for letting me know. Please go back to the ship. They may be allowed to watch, but you know what to do if they get on board! I'll be along soon to see for myself",
"Oh no, they have found me already! I guess they won't bother me with all the guards in town, so I'll be safe for now. But your ship can't leave for the mainland without them knowing.",
"So you are going to abandon your quest?",
"Never! They may suspect your ship of being used, but I know of other ways to get there. This will take some time, so please be sure you are ready. Talk to me again once you are. And in the meantime... don't anger the natives.",
"Will do.",
"Ah, you're awake at last. Your crew brought you here after they found you knocked out in front of the apothecary. You are lucky you survived. The whole place has been blown away! Several people perished because of it. Thankfully you were saved, but I'm afraid you'll feel the pain for quite a while still. Better be careful in your swordfights!",
"Thanks for tending my wounds. Is there anything I can do for you in return?",	//50
"I'm just happy to be of service. But if you ever come across any special birds, I would love to see them. Steven and I shared a passion for nature. With him gone now, I shall need to find my own interesting specimens. I have to go back to work now. Bye.",
"Bye...",
"Thanks captain, that was a close call. He suprised me but luckily we were able to beat him. I'll be on my way to the ship now!",
"Very well. Be careful that you aren't attacked again!",
"I've finished everything I still had to do. Now let's talk about that job again, Steven.",
"Excellent! I've made arrangements for someone in the tavern to await you. He can help you on your journey to the mainland. But be careful, we don't want to draw more attention.",
"Okay, I'll be on my way now! Hopefully when we talk again, I can deliver you these plants you are looking for.",
"Ah, there you are. Steven told me you are looking for passage to the mainland. As this is a secret operation, my ship is anchored at the lighthouse. Meet me there when you are ready to depart. Make sure you come at night and by land!",
"Okay.",
"Oh no! This is terrible, why did this have to happen?",
"I'm sorry, what are you doing here?",
"Oh, excuse me. Steven is a very good friend of mine and we shared a passion for nature together. I must see if I can help him now. If you ever find any nice specimens of wildlife, please bring them to me.",
"Okay, good luck.",
"Steven, could you tell me about some potions known as Hoasca I found? I would like to know what they do.",
"Those are some very rare potions, my friend. They are only made by the natives from the mainland. It is said to boost your fighting skills for a short period of time. Might be useful if you find yourself in a tough spot. You can also give it to your crew or officers to use.",
"That sounds very useful. Thanks for the information.",
"Captain! We are here to help you! Let's get them!",
"You arrived just in time!",
"That was a tense fight captain. Thank goodness you are safe. We've been going about mob handed since these indians attacked one of us. We saw you enter and were worried about a possible trap. Once we heard the fighting we thought maybe you could use some help. I hope you don't mind.",
"Not at all, I think I wouldn't have survived without your help. I have to go to the lighthouse now to meet with someone and then I will be gone for a few days. So I think you've earned a little shoreleave.",
"So what did he say?",
"*keep quiet and listen more*",
"I've heard enough! En Garde!",
"I've heard enough. Let's see if we can get away without being seen.",
"He said there is a deal, he also said he wanted to meet on a beach to conclude the deal because that is a safer location.",
"That does sound wise indeed. We should go to that beach then.",
"Yes, we should. But he said to wait until it's dark to draw less attention.",
"That sounds fair to me, that will give us time to gather the goods for him. Did he change his order or will he still require the same?",
"It's still the same, yes.",
"Okay, you did bury the extra goods we brought right?",
"Yes I've buried them behind the Abbey at the corner of the wall.",
"Good job, once we are done we can retrieve those goods and finally be on our way.",
"Didn't the chief also tell us to help with watching this Steven guy?",
"I've received a message today we don't have to help anymore. The captain they saw entering that building does seem to be a good man so we don't have to fear him.",
"Ah, that's good news. I wasn't looking forward to that at all.",
"Hey! Who is there?",
"Right! He did, it seems that captain who we saw entering his store is becoming a problem too.",
"Ah good! There you are.",
"Let's go.",
"What! My ship! What is happening here?",
"I bet it's those natives again. If they got to your ship they can't be far away. Prepare yourself!",
"Okay, follow me to the ship. You'll be at the mainland before you know it.",
"Okay, lets go.",
"I've changed my mind Steven, I can't do the donation for you after all.",
"I'm sorry to hear that, captain.",
"Bye.",
"Didn't I tell you to come at night! We are drawing way too much attention now!",
"But....",
"I can't continue with this quest Steven, we were discovered and the danger is becoming too much.",
"I'm sorry to hear that...",				//100
"I'm sorry too.",
"Well we aren't sorry. Better yet we are glad you finally came to your senses and abandoned this foolish quest.",
"What are you doing here!",
"Don't worry Captain, after I saw the explosions I expected this quest to be a failure so I contacted them.",
"You did what?!",
"He asked us if we could arrange a truce.",
" As our business here is almost done we agreed to this.",
" As you made sure our plan here was spoiled we agreed to this.",
" But we do want compensation for all the lives lost because of you!",
"What kind of compensation are you talking about?",
"Our contacts with the smugglers here aren't that good. So if you can get us ",
" opium plants we will call it square.",
" You should be able to get them at #sRedmond#.", 
"I guess I have no real choice do I?",
"No you don't, when you have them you can deliver them to me. I will be waiting downstairs in the hotel in #sCartagena#. You have ",
" months to get this done. If we still haven't received the goods by then we will find you!",
"Okay. See you at #sCartagena#",
"Huh? What are you doing here? Ah never mind. Move aside now I have to get back to the town.",
"...",
"I told you not to come by sea didn't I! We are drawing way too much attention now!",	//120
"Did you bring the opium?",
"Yes, here it is.",
"Sorry I haven't been able to get it yet.",
"Good. You won't see us again.",
"Good!",
"Welcome to #sCartagena#. I don't know what you need to do here but I hope it wont take too long. I will be waiting here until you are done.",
"Okay, thanks for the trip.",
"Are you ready to go back to #SGreenford#?",
"No I haven't yet done what I came here for.",
"Why don't you just die?",				//130
"Come to mock me? Go away!",
"You wouldn't hurt a poor man now would you?",
"Spare a coin for the poor #ssir#?",
"Can I help you #ssir#?",
"What do you need my friend?",
"I would like some information please",
"I don't think I'll trust you enough.",
"But ...",
"I'm looking for some natives like you who want to make a deal. They are supposed to be somewhere here.",
"Here have 10 coins. That should help you right?",	//140
"Thank you kind #ssir#.",
"You're welcome.",
"Your people are all the same ... generousity isn't one or your strongest points I assume?",
"I could really use your help. Here are 500 coins.",
"I've found this potion. Maybe you want some of it?",
"Ah thank you very much I really like this stuff.",
"You want to hear a story about my adventures? It might cheer you up a bit.",
"You sounds like a good #sgender#, Captain.",
"You sound like an awful person.",
"I should tell you about all your people I killed. You will certanly enjoy that.",	//150
"Why are you doing this?",
"Don't you like it?",
"You are a monster!",
"GO AWAY!",
"Sorry to bother you.",
"Ah, I've heard of one. He's working at the new Hotel.... Let me see I believe I have a flyer of that hotel...ah! Here you go.",
"I am ready to go back now.",
"Well Captain we made it back in one piece. I'm off on my own adventures again now. Maybe we will run into each other again. I wish you all the luck on your journey.",
"You stay safe too.",
"I'm sorry to inform you Steven but my quest was a failure.",	//160
"Don't worry captain. After you left they contacted me again. They told me there was no way you would be able to convince the leaders of their clan. So I gave in.",
"Believe it or not but I've got the plants now Steven.",
"Are you willing to trade them for a very rare Doctor's Toolkit?",
"Indeed I am.",
"I think an indian might have been eavesdropping in the tavern when I spoke with the captain. I followed him but lost him",
"Well we can't help that now Hmm.. unless a rumour I heard that they have dealings with the warehouse near the fort is true. Perhaps you could scout round there very cautiously? Otherwise just continue with the plan to go to the lighthouse after midnight that's the main thing.",
"I think an indian might have been eavesdropping in the tavern when I spoke with the captain. I followed him and he eventually went into a warehouse",
"Well it may be just a coincidence, you could check it out yourself or report them to the Commander at the prison. It's more important that you don't forget the plan to go to the lighthouse after midnight",
"Well I guess I'll have to fetch the opium to get these natives off my back",
"Ah my dear captain, indeed I am. However I need to ensure that your ship meets my purposes and alas I can't do that whilst it is not in port here. Perhaps you'll come back and see me next time it is",//170
"I may well do that",
"An indian attacked that member of my crew right outside",
"You could try reporting that to the authorities just across the way at the prison",
"OK I'll try that",
"I think an indian might have been eavesdropping in the tavern when I spoke with the captain. He left just after the captain did too.",
"Waste of time and energy",
"I think an indian might have been eavesdropping in the tavern when I spoke with the captain. I followed him and taking no chances, killed him",
"Huh? What are you doing here? Ah never mind. It's late and I have to get back to the town.",
"Report at the prison!! I don't do prisons. Savvy?",
"Report them to the Authorities?? Do you forget I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Me and the Authorities don't see eye to eye.",
