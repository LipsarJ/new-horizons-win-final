"Hello #ssir#. I'm so worried, could you please help me?",
"Perhaps; Depends on what you're worried about. What's the problem?",
"My father, François, left the city two weeks ago without letting me know and now I have no idea where he is.",
"Why did he leave the city?",
"He didn't tell me. The only thing I know is that one evening he was still there, the next morning he had disappeared. He left me at daybreak when I was sleeping.",
"Have you informed the authorities about your missing father?",
"Yes, but they don't seem to have any interest in helping me find him.",
"It's always the same with the governors on these islands. They'll always leave the helping of citizens up to random captains that happen to pass by. Lucky for you, you just found such a random captain. I'll leave to find your father straight away.",
"And they're quite right. I don't have much interest in it either. I recommend you get yourself a guy and forget all about that father of yours.",
"*Gasps* Oh, thank you so much for finding him, #ssir#!",
"You're quite welcome. It hasn't been easy, but I managed to in the end.",
