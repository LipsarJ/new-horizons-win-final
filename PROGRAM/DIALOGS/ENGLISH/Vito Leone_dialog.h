"Captain, you're still here? ",

" is unlikely to be surprised if you delay in attacking him for too long.",
"...",
"What can I do for you?",
"Is your name ",
"Vito Leone",
"Vito Leone",
"?",
"You've done very well, captain! Here is your 10000 gold. I trust you found my daughter well? Pretty is she not? Well, I'd best go and let her out of that cell. Listen, if you ever need to...plan a funeral for someone, be sure to let us know, we'll provide the best service - at a decent discount. Come along you two, we have much to discuss.",
"Thanks and farewell.",
"Yes, that's me. And you must be ",
". I've heard a lot about your success performing certain...jobs.",
"You arrived a week ago, and you already know who I am and what I've been doing? Why?",
"In my line of work, lacking information is far more dangerous than any bullet or sword. I see that you're surprised - ",
"Mateus Santos",
" hasn't told you who I am, right?",
"You do know everything, don't you? Yes, ",
"Mateus Santos",
" told me that you are a messenger, and the news you have brought is very dangerous.",
"A messenger? Quite the joker, that ",
"Mateus Santos",
" of yours. Captain, I am no messenger. I represent an organization that a Philistine might call the assassin guild. And I come not to bring news, but to sentence an imposter.",
"Is that so? And who is this imposter?",
"Our esteemed mister ",
"Mateus Santos",
", as you might have guessed. Two years ago, he appeared out of nowhere, killed the head of our organization's local branch, and assumed his place.",
"...",
"In theory, we could shut our eyes to this impudence, if he showed us some respect. But he not only killed our representative, he also stopped sharing profit with the guild. This, as you can understand, we could not forgive.",
"...",
"We tried to get rid of ",
"Mateus Santos",
" with the help of local mercenaries, but he is a resourceful man and has managed to thwart all attempts on his life. On top of all of this, he has stolen something very precious to me, and I am determined to see it returned. For all of these reasons the guild has decided to send its own man to deal with the problem.",
"And ",
"Mateus Santos",
" has promised me a hefty reward for the head of his would-be assassin - you.",
"Of course he did! Now that things are really serious, he understands who he's dealing with, and is afraid. But, my death won't change anything now - ",
"Mateus Santos",
" is going to die, very soon.",
"So, this won't stop me from killing you and getting my reward.",
"Oh, you could kill me...but you'll likely receive a bullet as reward for your efforts. Do you seriously think that ",
"Mateus Santos",
" will let you live after talking to me? I'm afraid that this is your last job, captain.",
"Hmm...but if it is as you describe, what do you suggest?",
"Do you think me a fool? You want to live, and will say anything to save yourself. I'll kill you and get my reward!",
"I see two options for you in this situation. The first, let me live and go your own way. The second, help me to eliminate ",
"Mateus Santos",
". The latter option will earn you a considerable amount of money.",
"Hmm...I've no objection to money... and things that I've learned about him from others are giving your story some credibility. But how are you planning to kill ",
"Mateus Santos",
"? His house is well-guarded, to say the least...",
"No way, deal with ",
"Mateus Santos",
" on your own! I'm out of this. Goodbye.",
"Do you think me a fool? You want to live, and will say anything to save yourself. I'll kill you and get my reward!",
"Your recent activities have kept your employer preoccupied, and while his attention has been focused upon you it has escaped his notice that two of his most trusted subordinates have been suborned. They will make certain that your target has no more guards about him, when you attack his house, than you'll be able to handle. Go now to his house, once you have killed him, search his abode. Any treasures you find there you may keep, with the exception of the precious object that I claim as my own, I will be waiting for you nearby, and then I'll pay you your 10000 gold.",
"At this point I'm not sure who to trust except my sword and pistol. I will kill him, but if you've lied to me, be assured that you'll be dealing with both of them, and information won't be the only thing you'll be lacking.",
"No way, deal with ",
"Mateus Santos",
" on your own! I'll have no part in this. Goodbye.",
"10000 gold is tempting, but I was offered 20000 gold for you. Make peace with your maker, because the bidding is over.",
