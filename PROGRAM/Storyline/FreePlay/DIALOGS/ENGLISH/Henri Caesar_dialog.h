"Leave me alone!",
"Are you fine? Who are you?",
"Why are you asking? You're an officer on this ship. You should know I'm a prisoner?",
"No, I'm not officer and I'm not working for the English.",
"What!? Why do you wear this uniform? Don't tell me you are a spy??",
"To tell the truth, I'm working for the American side and the Governor of #sisland_Eleuthera#. I'm here to sink this warship.",
"What?! How?",
"I'm going to blow up the powder magazine. If you want to live, you should follow me.",
"Are you joking?! Of course, I want to run away from this ship. Take off these chains, please!",
"Thank you, Captain. I'm Henri Caesar, I was still captain of a schooner a few days ago.",
"What did it happen to you?",
"Bad luck! I attacked a British merchant ship and before boarding her, this warship appeared on the horizon. It was too late to sail away. I've had to surrender in order to not be sunk.",
"You're a pirate?",
"Let's say, I try to survive. I belong to the Pirate Brotherhood of Nevis.",
"Alright, let's stop chatting. We must leave the ship as soon as possible. Some soldiers could come here at any time. I just need one minute to plant the bomb and start its countdown.",
"Thank you, Captain! I thought I would never be free again.",
"You're welcome. And now? What will you do?",
"I want to leave this devil island. It's too dangerous for me.",
"Come with me to #sEleuthera#. I and Captain Lafitte, we must inform the Governor we succeeded in our mission.",
"Great! Certainly, I'll find a ship to go back to Nevis and meet my companions again.",
"I think so. Board my ship!",
"Thank you, Captain! I'm safe here. Now, I can look for a ship sailing for Nevis.",
"As I said, It won't be hard to find a ship. Glad to help you. May the wind be always at your back!",
