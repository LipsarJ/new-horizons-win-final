"(Talking to Fernando) Finally, here you are. I thought not to see you again.",
"It's a long story. But, Fernando has had to deal with some 'mishaps'. Let's go to the most important point. Any clue about the Bartolomeu's whereabouts?",
"Maybe... Bartolomeu wrote the pirates could be some former crewmen of Henry Morgan.",
"I know Bartolomeu made at least one expedition with Henry Morgan. Maybe, there has been a dispute with this group and they retaliated kidnapping his son.",
"If this dispute has existed, I don't think it occurred during an expedition of Henry Morgan but later... After his life of pirate.",
"What do you know exactly?",
"When Henry Morgan stopped his career of privateer, a group of former crewmen lead by Guillaume Auger has continued the piracy. Maybe, these pirates were the kidnappers of his son.",
"Did they have a favorite place?",
"Like Henry Morgan, between expeditions, they used to rest at Ile a Vache.",
