"Ha! Give you money? Never. Watch and wait, within a few hours, my crew comes in and save me.",
"If you say so, #ssir#. But it is your choice. Enjoy your stay, haha!",
"Do you also hear this weird hissing noise?", 
"Enjoying yourself?",
"No, of course not. How can you be amused over prisoner's situations, dog!",
"Oh come on, don't be that offensive! You are talking to a fellow countryman. I am #scountry# too and I can let you free. For #smoney# pieces of eight, you are a free #sgender# again.",
"#smoney#!? That only leaves me 1! It is better than to stay rotting here. Very well, it is a deal. Now get me out!",
"After you, #ssir#.",
"That was the last of them. Now get out of here before more guards arrive!",
"Aren't you coming with me? They won't be so happy to find out you've been helping a prisoner.",
"There's no survivors, so they don't need to know. Now lock me into that cell so it'll look like I had nothing to do with your release!",
"You must REALLY like your job if you're willing to take the risk of staying. Good luck!",
"fiercely independent",
"actually a pirate",
