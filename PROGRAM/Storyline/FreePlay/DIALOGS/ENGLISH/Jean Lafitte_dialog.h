"What do you want?",
"I'm Joaquim de Almeida. I'm Captain and the Governor of #sisland_Eleuthera# asked me to deliver this letter.",
"Humm... So, it seems you'll be my partner for the mission.", 
"Right. Have you found any men for your crew?",
"Almost... People know me on #sTortuga#. It won't be hard to find some more men. Meanwhile, take a seat, I'll join you in a few minutes.",
"Done! I have men enough for the mission.",
"Good. However, do you already have a plan?",
"I think so. I suppose you know a warship sent from England moored on #sisland_Turks# recently.",
"Yes, Governor told me.", 
"The garrison of #sisland_Turks# would not be enough to attack #sEleuthera#. However, the HMS Endeavour, a battleship carrying many hundred of soldiers is there preparing the attack.",
"I was not expecting a such force. How can we defeat them? It seems to be a suicide mission stopping them.",
"Of course, we won't fight them in a battlefield.",
"So?",
"The battleship is their most important asset. We must sink her.",
"On sea that's impossible.",
"You're right. But in the port, we have a chance to do that.",
"How?",
"We need to plant a bomb in her gunpowder magazine. The explosion will sink her in a few minutes and kill many of the soldiers.",
"That's feasible but how to reach the gunpowder magazine without being detected?",
"Without being detected, it's indeed impossible. However, someone dressed like an British officer would be less suspicious.",
"You're right. But, there is no guarantee he won't be recognized and arrested.",
"I admit. But, I don't see any other way.",
"At least, we could increase the chance creating a diversion.",
"How?",
"Let's our crewmembers attack the guards and buildings near the town gates to attract the greatest possible number of soldiers. The crewmembers can always run to the jungle to evade them. Meanwhile, it'll be easier to board the ship.",
"Maybe. Anyway, before executing the plan, we must know how the town is secured.",
"Of course.",
"We have no time to waste. I must still stay a few minutes in the tavern to talk to my new recruits. Wait for me in the port, so we can set sail to #sisland_Turks# as soon as possible.",
"As you wish.",
"Well. Time to go, Captain.",
"It would be better to avoid the #sisland_Turks#' port, don't you think?",
"Indeed, I think the Lighthouse' shore is the perfect start for our mission.", 
"I would say: So far so good, Captain!",
"Yes, the easiest part of the mission is done.",
"Exact. Now, let's go to the town and be careful with some bandits we could meet on the way.",
"Alright, Captain Lafitte.",
"We should go to the port to check if the ship is still there and how many guards are protecting her.",
"Indeed. Let's go!",
"Here's the ship! Right in front of the port.",
"A big one, indeed. At least, I don't see any guards in the port.",
"The British are pretty confident about the town security. Let's go to the tavern to talk about the next step.",
"As I said, dressed like a Royal Navy officer, we have more chance to plant the bomb.",
"This kind of outfit is not sold in a tailor shop. We must capture an officer.",
"Have you got an idea?",
"Maybe. First, we must find a prostitute in #sisland_Turks#.",
"What? we are here for a mission not to take good times.",
"I was talking about our mission of course. She could help us.",
"How?",
"She could 'motivate' him to spend some time far from his colleagues. Perfect to stun him and steal his outfit.",
"Well, this should be done just before boarding the ship.",
"Indeed, we must avoid his absence can be noticed.",
"Tomorrow night, the ship must be sunk. No time to waste.",
"Alright, let's find right now a prostitute. This should not be too hard.",
"The barmaid must certainly help us.",
"I'm going to talk to her.",
"It's late. I hope she'll do her part.",
"Me too. Maybe, I should go to the tavern... Wait! she's coming.",
"Done! Stunned",
"Ok, let's take off his uniform.",
"You've already paid the first half. I'll pay her the rest.",
"Thanks, Captain.",
"Ready?",
"Yes. So, where is the bomb I need to plant?",
"Take it. It's small enough to be hidden under your uniform.",
"Thanks. How much time before it explodes?",
"Around 10 minutes. Just enough to move away from the ship.",
"And your men?",
"They are waiting for you. They'll take you in the boat. Board the ship discreetly and avoid the guards of course. No one can note you are not belonging to the crew.",
"And what about the diversion?",
"Don't worry. As planned, some of my crewmembers are waiting to attack some soldiers in the town and attract them far from the port.", 
"Great. So, time to go.",
"Congratulations Captain, you did it!",
"Thank you. Let's go back to the lighthouse. We must move away from this town in order to avoid the guards.",
"Time to leave, Captain?",
"Right. I've appreciated to be your partner in this mission on #sisland_Turks#.",
"Me too. Maybe in the future, we'll make more expeditions together.",
"Yes, why not... Hurry up Captain! the Governor is waiting for you to give the reward. See you!",
"I agree.",
