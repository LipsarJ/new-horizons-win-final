"Who are you, Senor?",
"I'm Captain Joaquim de Almeida. I met an employee of your husband's trade company in #sEleuthera#.",
"Thanks to God, you're here! My husband is in danger and I thought you could be the right man to deal with this situation.",
"What happened to your husband?",
"My husband went to #sSantiago# for business but he was captured by pirates and now they ask a ransom if I want to see him alive.",
"So, it's a kidnapping. How did they contact you?",
"I've received a letter. I must pay the ransom contacting someone in #sSantiago.",
"Why don't you just pay the ransom?",
"They ask a lot and above all I have no confidence in them. They could keep the ransom and kill him anyway.",
"You're right affirming it's a dangerous situation. I could also be killed in this mission.",
"If you come back with my husband, I'll pay you 30000 gold coins.",
"I expected more, Senorita...",
"I understand... Well, my last offer is 40000 gold coins. I cannot pay more.",
"That's better. I agree to help you. Who is the man I must contact in #sSantiago#?",
"Not enough, unfortunately. I must decline your offer. Find someone else for this mission. Goodbye!",
"I'll do. Goodbye, Captain.",
"In the letter, the pirates told I had to speak with the tavern keeper of #sSantiago# and ask for Abel Barco.",
"Alright. I'll do my best to come back with your husband.",
"Thank you, Captain. I'm eager to see this nightmare ended.",
"Thank you Captain! Thank you so much! You did it! My husband is back.",
"It was not easy. But yes, we did it.",
"As promised, here's your reward: 40000 gold coins.",
