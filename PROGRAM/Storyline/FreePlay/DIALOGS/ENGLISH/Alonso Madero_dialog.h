"Are you Captain Joaquim de Almeida?",
"Yes, I am. What do you want?",
"I know you are a Portuguese privateer and my mistress needs your help.",
"I used to work for Governors not for private individuals...",
"I understand. But, she needs someone dealing with dangerous situations. And for that, she agrees to pay well.",
"That sounds interesting now. Where is she?",
"Sorry, but I have no time for this kind of work. Find someone else. Goodbye!",
"Goodbye, Captain!",
"She doesn't live in this island. In fact, she lives in #sHavana#.",
"Humm... That's annoying. I did not intend to go to #sisland_Cuba# these next weeks.",
"Indeed, but as I said you could earn a lot...",
"I hope so. Well, I agree to help. We can weigh anchor now if you want.",
"After all, I won't accept to help. Sorry, but find someone else. Goodbye!",
"Unfortunately, I cannot go with you right now. Her husband has a trade company in which I work and I must stay here for business these days.",
"Where does she live in #sHavana#?",
"Her house is just in front of the town hall. Her name is Elvira Carranza... Captain, don't spend too much time to see her. Her husband is in danger.",
"Alright, I'll do my best. See you!",
