"Sorry, #smister#, I can't stop to chat.",
"Fair enough. I'll let you get on with your work.",
"Sorry, if you need someone to load or unload your ship, you'll have to find someone else. I'm busy.",
"Yes, you look it. Which ship are you loading?",
"The '",
"'. Captain ",
" is a real slave driver. If I don't get the ship loaded soon, I won't get paid.",
"You look worn out. Why don't you head off to the tavern for a drink and let me take over for a while? I get paid by the hour so it doesn't matter which ship I load.",
"Oh, you work here? I've never seen you before.",
"I've just been hired. Anyway, as I said, I'm paid by the hour, so I can either take over here, or I can go and find some other work if you don't want a break.",
"Alright, I'll leave you to it. Just remember to tell the guard on deck that you're working for Captain ",
", otherwise you won't be allowed on board.",
"I'll remember. And you enjoy your break!",
"Thanks for taking over from me. But you'd better get to work or we'll both be in trouble!",
"Yes, I'll start moving cargo now.",
"Can I help you, #smiss#?",
"Perhaps. Which ship is that out there?",
"Thank you, I was looking for the '",
"'. I'll just go aboard now.",
"Hey, you can't go aboard our ship!",
"Captain ",
" is expecting me. But don't worry, I won't tell him what you called him. Goodbye and thanks again for your help!",
"It was nice talking to you, #smadam#.",
"Thank you. And thank you also for pointing Captain ",
"'s ship out for me.",
"Who are you? I wasn't expecting to see anyone else down here.",
"It's a good thing I am here. You wouldn't be able to move this by yourself. Help me with it, will you?",
"Phew! It's certainly heavy. What's in it - cannonballs?",
"Or maybe a body - ha ha!",
"Ho ho! But you're right, I wouldn't be able to lift it alone. Alright... one, two, three, HEAVE!",
"Right... let's get it... up on deck...",
"At last! We finally got the thing off the ship.",
"Thanks for your help. I don't know about you, but I'm worn out - time for a break, I say.",
"That's not a bad idea. See you back on the ship in ten minutes.",
"Don't wait for me if I'm late!",
