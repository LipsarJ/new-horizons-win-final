"I'd like to talk to you about a small piece of business.",
"I'm just here to pay my respects, #saddr#. Nothing more.",
"In that case, please leave my study and let me get back to more important matters.",
"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to talk about right now",
"Oh yes? I have a proposition for you, captain.",
"Indeed?",
"I have learned that you completed the task successfully; my congratulations, captain! Here is your reward.",

"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"Well, I have a mission if you are interested.",
"Maybe. What is it exactly?",
"Two months ago a convoy of French merchant ships left #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# to sail for #sHavana#. My daughter, Justine, was on board one of the ships. One month after the convoy was to arrive, I sent my best Captain and the frigate 'La Foudre' to search for them. But I have heard no news from either since..",
"So you want me to search for both the frigate and the convoy? Why don't you send another ship of your own?",
"Unfortunately I don't have the military resources to spare another one of my ships. With #sFalaise De Fleur# being the only colony on #sisland_Falaise De Fleur#, I would be looked down upon by my people if I were to compromise the safety of the colony for a personal cause.",
"Very well, Sir. So now onto the things that matter. How much will you pay me if I bring back your daughter?",
"I can afford no more than 40000 gold coins.",
"That sounds pretty good to me. I accept your offer. Expect to hear from me soon.",
"I'm sorry, Governor, but I have to decline. I cannot spare the time required for such an endeavour.",
"Thank you ever so much! Please make finding my daughter your highest priority, captain.",
"I'll do my best, sir.",
"I understand, captain. Hopefuly I will find another privateer willing to do the job.",
"The best of luck, governor.",
"Thank God! You brought my daughter back!",
"Indeed Governor, but the pirate who kidnapped your daughter also came here!",
"An officer reported the arrival of the pirate ship a few minutes ago. Please Captain, help my soldiers to repel the enemy. Meanwhile, I'm going to hide Justine in a secret room here in the residence.",
"Wise decision Sir. I'm going to join the fight right now! (THINKS: Hopefully I don't have to do much fighting though)",
"Congratulations Captain! you did a fantastic job.",
"Thank you sir, that was a dangerous mission.",
"Indeed! Justine spoke to me of Davy Jones. That Pirate seems to be the Devil. Fortunately, thanks to you, he won't soon come back.",
"I think so Governor. Now the mission is accomplished, I have other priorities but before we should talk about the reward, aye... savvy?",
"Of course. As agreed, here are the 40 000 gold coins! Thanks again and Goodbye Captain.",
"Goodbye Governor.",

"Some time ago a convoy of French merchant ships left #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# to sail for #sHavana#. My daughter, Justine, was on board one of the ships. One month after the convoy was to arrive, I sent my best Captain and the frigate 'La Foudre' to search for them. But I have heard no news from either since.",
"I can't say I'm happy to see you, but I don't suppose I have any choice - you've got some very influential friends.",
"Thank you, sir.",
"So, one of the most wanted men in the archipelago appears right in front of me? Guards!!!",
"Call off your men at once, or a certain lady by the name of ",
"Virginie d'Espivant",
" will die. I don't believe her father will be happy to learn you could have prevented her death.",
"I'm listening. What do you want?",
"On my ship I have a lady named ",
"Virginie d'Espivant",
"...",
"You've found her?! Thank God! But, tell me captain - is she a guest as fitting her station or a prisoner on your ship?",
"She's safe and secure, savvy? Although it was pure coincidence that I found her.",
"Of course not! On the contrary, she's my honored guest.",
"I'm pleased to hear that. How did you find her?",
"It's a long story, sir. I'm sure ",
"Virginie d'Espivant",
" will tell you herself, if she deems it necessary.",
"Yes, of course. I won't delay you anymore. Accept this money with my deepest thanks, and I'll arrange for the girl to be escorted from the port when you deliver her to the shore.",
"Certainly, sir.",
"So you're holding her there for ransom?",
"Yes. And I'd like it noted that she got there by pure coincidence.",
"It's noted. Now, what do you want for her freedom?",
"Money. And unhindered passage back to my ship, of course.",
"How much?",
" I think 7000 gold will be enough.",
"What? Are you out of your mind?!",
"Do you really think this is an appropriate time for haggling, sir?",
"All right. Here's the money. And you have my guarantee of safe passage to your ship. Let the girl go.",
"Your guarantee? I'm told you're a man of your word, but I'm not going to risk my neck to find out. You'll get the girl when I've put to sea.",
"Very well. But be warned: cross me, and I'll order every available ship to bring me your head!",
"Agreed. And may you remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!",
"I see. Well, I am forced to say this - I had to forgive you all of your crimes against my country...",
"Such an honor, sir!",
"Mind your sarcasm! If I had my way, you'd be hanging in the town square. You have the young lady you saved to thank for my generosity.",
"My gratitude is infinite, sir!",
"I'm sure. Moreover, I'm ordered to pay you a reward. Here it is. And now, please do me one favor: leave.",
"With pleasure, sir.",
