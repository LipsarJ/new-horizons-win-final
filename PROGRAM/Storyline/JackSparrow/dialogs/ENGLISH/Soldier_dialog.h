"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"No, of course. I am a captain, after all...but I see you are not listening.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets. You can defend yourself, of course, if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such unbearable weather...and I've got to stand here in it. You may not believe me, but my only pastime is fighting the flies that try to land on my face.",
"That's most unfortunate, but I can't help you. It's your duty.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got my duty to do, and it's not my duty to talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",
"Do you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It is a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"Tell me some other time. I've got to go.",
"Go your way, don't bother me.",
"As you say, soldier.",
"Hey! Will you bring me a cup of rum from the tavern?",
"Perhaps. But won't they hang me up for helping a soldier get drunk on duty? No, wait 'til they change the guard, and then you can drink as much as you wish.",
"Why must it be a rough-looking sailor like you trying to talk to me?! Aren't there any beautiful women in this city?",
"And you call this doing your duty? Look, you wouldn't want to miss capturing some dangerous criminal like myself, would you? Ha-ha!",
"You look pretty healthy. Don't you want to join our army? We've got lots of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I'll have to decline your offer. Army discipline doesn't agree with me.",
"This heat.... I'd give anything to return back to the Europe, to the civilization...",
"Yes, it doesn't look like this weather suits you.",
"Right-ho, you bilge rat. You're under arrest. You'll be spending the night in prison. Take his weapons, George.",
"Wait, you've made a mistake. As I was trying to tell the buffoon behind the bar, I am helping Miss Brinkley here, to find her sisters. Ask the lady yourself.",
"It was Brin, not Brinkley. And there's no lady about in here. You've been drinking too much, sailor boy!",
"Er... well, so there isn't... But if there's no lady, then there's no crime... if you gets me drift...",
"He's got a point there, Harry. We can't arrest him for nothing... can we?",
"Yes, George has got it right. And no crime, no time, right?",
"Hmm! I don't need another run in with the Guard Commander. So I suppose you can go. But... we'll be watching you!",
"No problem, gentlemen. I shall be as good as gold.",
"Well, well! Look who we have here, the bilge rat from the tavern. And on a known smugglers beach too!",
"Er... Hello again... Harry isn't it?",
"It's 'officer' to you! George, Take his weapons and search him.",
"Now come on, officer! This is a bit bold, isn't it?",
"Aha! As I suspected... DIAMONDS! You're one of those accursed diamond smugglers. Come on George, Let's get the sea scum off to jail. The Guard Commander will thank us for this one!",
"Wait! Can't we discuss this?",
"Well, Sir, he WAS chasing someone when we arrived.",
"Yes! Yes! And tell him how you saved my life!",
"Er.., Ah! Er.., well, we may have been contributory in saving this man’s life. IF, he was being robbed. But, he did have the diamonds on him. That's why we brought him in... Sir.",
"An understandable mistake, soldier. With all the commotion going on.",
