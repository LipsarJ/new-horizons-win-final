"Leave now you scurvy sea dog. Your sort are not welcome here!",
"...",
"Welcome Captain. I am indebted to you for returning my daughters to me unharmed, and it will provide a great relief to their mother to know of their safe return.",
"I am just pleased to have been of service, your Lordship.",
"Come, come sir, you are too modest. You put yourself to considerable risk in obtaining their freedom. My daughters mentioned your bravery in entering the pirate encampment.",
"As I said, your Lordship, I am happy to have been of service.",
"Well, Captain, that service shall not go unrewarded. You may have your choice, gold or a new ship. What is your pleasure?",
"Your Lordship, I am undeserving for such a small service, but gold is always pleasant to receive. [THINKS] Another payday coming!",
"Your Lordship, My ship has seen better days so a new one would be most beneficial. ",
"Very well Captain. Take this gold and go with my heartfelt thanks.",
"So be it Captain. Here are the papers granting you title to your new ship which you will find in the harbour.",
"I thank you for your generosity your Lordship.",
"I regret I have pressing matters of State which to attend, so I must ask that you leave.",
"Yes your Lordship.",
"I must ready the family for a trip to England now we are reunited.",
"I too have other matters to attend, so I bid you goodbye my Lord.",
".",
"Here's a gold piece my man. Spend it wisely.",
"Somehow I don't think you are the poor drunkard you pretend to be. What is your story?",
"Don't waste my time old you rogue, you probably have more money than I do.",
"---",
"---",
".",
"Well, having now smelt your foul breath, I don't think I'm looking for the likes of you after all",
"Indeed, and what makes you think that?",
"You had worked out, that if I really was a drunk, the landlord would have thrown me out hours ago.",
"Hmmm! Something like that, I must admit. So why have you been looking for ME in particular?",
"It wasn't you, in particular, but someone who is astute and has their wits about them.",
"Well, I think I might fit that description. So can we get down to businnes?",
"Very well. If you're up to a bit of risk taking, there is a damsel, shall we say, 'in distress' who could use the help of a strong young Captain such as yourself. Are you up to it?",
"No, I think not. The ladies always seem to get me in trouble. So I'll bid you good day.",
"Damsels in distress are a speciality of mine! What do I need to do? .",
"As you wish, my brave Captain. The lady in question has been listening to us talking, and she has just signalled me that she thinks you might be able to help her. She has just slipped outside and will be waiting for you behind the Tavern. Go now, and meet with her there.",
"Very intriguing! I'll go and meet this mystery woman of yours. [THINKS:] There might be some leverage in this.",
"As you wish, my bold Captain. I'll see you don't fail. Board the ship of the smuggler and to #sTortuga# you sail.",
"Thanks, I know this is going to be fast. Next stop #sTortuga#.",
"Jack Sparrow's Adventure is the one you have sought. Just jump in your ship and sail to that port.",
"I will sail there from here. It wont take too long.",
"A long Journey my Captain, that's a good way to sail. I have given you food so your quest you don't fail.",
"Ah! Thanks. When I wake up I will be on #sisland_Turks# Port Jetty.",
"Good Captain, I'll do as you ask. To #sTortuga# you'll go, which is no easy task.",
"So I need to find Mr. Gibbs when I get there.",
"Looks like you'll be needing my help again Captain.",
"Hey! You get around don't you? What's going here? Nothing makes any sense so far.",
"Patience Captain, patience... This is not the place to talk. Let's go upstairs.",
"This better be good. And can you stop that drunken beggar disguise? It grates, you know.",
"I know you're confused, but we had to be sure you were the one for the job.",
"Job! What job? And yes, I'm confused.",
"You know why I'm here, Billy. Can we get down to business?",
"Don't waste my time old you rogue, you probably have more money than I do.",
"I know why you're here, you know I'm the best. Just be sure that you meant it and haven't just guessed. Have you preset your levels, equipment and all? If not my dear Captain in the mire you will fall.",
"Ooops! Sorry, no this isn't what I wanted. Goodbye.",
"Yes... I am testing the waters. If you know what I mean.",
"So, my fair Captain, where will you go? Just tell me your wish, and I'll make it just so.",
"I'll stay right here thanks and see what transpires.",
"I need to test the Mutiny with Barbossa.",
"I want to start by going to #sTortuga#, where I meet Anamaria.",
"I want to sail to #sRedmond# for the 'Grand Entrance' sequence.",
"I want to go with Norrington to #sisland_Turks# Island for the alternative CotBP quest line.",
"I want #sTortuga#, where I pick up a crew and find the #scursed_ship#.",
"As you wish my brave Captain, just slip past the fleet. Sail to the Lighthouse, and Barbossa you'll meet.",
"Thanks Billy. I'll try that.",
"As you wish my bold Captain. I'll see you don't fail. Board the ship of the smuggler and to #sTortuga# you sail.",
"Thanks, I know this is going to be fast. Next stop #sTortuga#.",
"Come, come sir, you are too modest. You put yourself to considerable risk in obtaining their freedom. My daughters mentioned your bravery in entering the pirate encampment. And your services in this endeavour, Mistress Shaypen, have earned you a considerable promotion.",
"Well, Captain, that service shall not go unrewarded. There is a fine ship recently captured, which I now grant ownership to you in recognition of your services to the crown. She is moored in the harbour. Here are the papers of ownership.",
