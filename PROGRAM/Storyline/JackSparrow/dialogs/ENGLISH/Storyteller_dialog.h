"It's late already. I'd better find some place to stay for the night.",
"The tavern should be on the left side at a pier. #sTortuga# always has some drunken mates who are fighting with each other, but they shouldn't bother me.",
"It's all a ploy to sell more rum! I suppose I'll just occupy myself in the tavern hall, then.",
"I'd better find myself a seat. It's going to be a long night.",
"Ahoy there, matey! Why don't you join me for a cup 'o rum and a good sailor's story?",
"Certainly, good sir. It seems I've got plenty of time to spare.",
"Ah, yes. I've got a truly amazing story to tell ye. It all starts out with a young lad named Jack Sparrow.",
"Sparrow, you say? Isn't he that famous pirate?",
"The very same! But he wasn't always a pirate, ye know? He started out as a cartographer, back in Old England...",
"But his father was a famous pirate too, wasn't he?",
"Aye, he was. But young Sparrow didn't much care for his father's profession. He wanted to make his living as an honest person.",
"An honest person? Jack Sparrow? But he's the most rogueish swashbuckler I've ever heard of!",
"Indeed that's what he became. But it wasn't so in the early days. He had a quiet office in the streets of Southampton, but the lure of the sea proved too strong. He commissioned himself a ship and set off towards the New World.",
"But fate had different plans for him. Young Jack ended up in an epic story that would have repercussions for everybody who sails the seas! One wrong turn and who knew what would happen next?",
"Is that so? Well, this is most amusing I've got to admit, but you've got to be a bit more specific to impress ME!",
"Are you questioning my story? His arrival in #sGrand Cayman# port set things into motion that nobody would've believed if he didn't see it with his own eyes...",
"Now 10 years later Jack was finally approached by Anamaria in the tavern.",
"Hang on! Captain Jack Sparrow just got a new ship, what are the tales of this ship?",
"So nothing happened in the next 10 years for Jack?",
"Very well I shall tell you. You should know however Captain Jack lost the ship the next time he sailed into the #sTortuga# port. He was then stuck on #sTortuga# doing the odd errand, until one day Anamaria came up to him while he was sitting in the very seat you are in now...",
"That is right, although Jack had a new ship he sailed back to #sTortuga# and it was stolen while he was in port. So once again Jack found himself without a ship. He was then stuck on #sTortuga# doing the odd errand, until one day Anamaria came up to him while he was sitting in the very seat you are in now...",
"That is right, Jack was without a ship so he was then stuck on #sTortuga# doing the odd errand, until one day Anamaria came up to him while he was sitting in the very seat you are in now...",
"... Aye! It is getting rather late Jack, I will see you around.",
"Thank you for the talk Mr. Gibbs, as usual.",
