"My name is Ammand... the Corsair!",
"Captain Jack Sparrow.",
"Hello captain, my name is Ammand the Corsair. I am the Pirate Lord of the Black Sea, and you are?",
"Captain Jack Sparrow.",
"Captain Jack Sparrow, Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. Savvy?",
"I believe you have been sent by the church, to find if Father Jerald is guilty. Am I correct?",
"Yes, that is correct, Ammand.",
"I have information that tells me that his assistant, Gilbert Ballester, has letters that show that he is guilty...",
"Thanks for the infomation.",
"I wasn't finished, captain Sparrow. We can use this infomation to blackmail him into giving us money for the letters. Follow me!",
"A very interesting offer. I shall think it over while we go to the church.",
"Captain, put these robes on. It will be easier for you to gain Father Jerald's trust if he thinks you are a cleric. I would suggest you get the letters of the assistant first as well.",
"Thank you, Ammand. What are you going to do now?",
"Never you mind, captain. I will find you later to get my half of the money.",
"Farewell for now then, Ammand",
"So captain Sparrow, where is my money?",
"Ammand... I um.. I didn't end up blackmailing the priest.",
"So what you're trying to say is that all I get from this is a stupid gold statue from the church??? You will pay for this, Jack Sparrow!",
"Maybe. But not today, Ammand!",
"Maybe. But not today, Ammand! (THINKS: Maybe it was not so wise to lie to a Pirate Lord)",
"Good day, captain. I have information that might help you. But I will not share it with you until I know I can trust you. Visit the pirate settlement on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# so that the chief there can vouch for you.",
"I might just do that. I've been considering joining the Brethren of the Coast anyway. Until we meet again!",
