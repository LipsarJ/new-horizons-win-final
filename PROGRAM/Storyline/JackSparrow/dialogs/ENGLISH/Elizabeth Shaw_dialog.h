"When do we sail to #sPhilipsburg#?",
"Never.",
"What?! But this assassin told me you were taking me to #sPhilipsburg#.",
"You don't seem to like Davy Jones.",
"Are you joking? I'll never love him.",
"Easily guessed.. In fact, I'm working for your father and I'm here to rescue you.", 
"GOD REWARD YOU!",
"In this case, it will be your father. But we must not waste time, we need to sail to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# as quickly as possible. I don't think your «lover» will desist from you so easily.",
"At last, you have woken up.",
"Yes, but what happened?",
"Do you not remember?",
"OOOhhh yes, Davy Jones shot me.",
"Indeed, but the bullet, fortunately, only scratched your head and you passed out.",
"I understand...and Davy Jones?",
"He quickly left the island. And shortly afterwards, the fort's garrison arrived at the port and saw you stretched out. Now you seem to be restored, you should go to the townhall and talk to my father. He has your reward waiting for you.",
"That's good news!",
