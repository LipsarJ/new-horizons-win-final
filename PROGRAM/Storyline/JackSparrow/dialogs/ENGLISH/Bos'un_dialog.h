"Aye Sir!",
"Nothing.",
"I just escaped from the slavers at the ship wreck!",
"We are heading that way now, what can you tell us?",
"There is three slavers down at the ship and I think they will be taking the treasure soon. I can help you fight them and I ask only to be able to travel with you in return.",
"Deal, what is your name?",
"Just call me Bos'un. Let us move then captain.",
"Ok Bos'un, lets go.",
"Just call me Nigel. Let us move then captain.",
"Ok Nigel, lets go.",
"Sir, I was on the same field as Gombo, he will want us to free more and more slaves at a big loss for you.",
"What do you suggest we do then?",
"We save the slaves on #sisland_Eleuthera# and then if he asks for you to free more we knock out him and his crew and take money as compensation.",
"Sounds like a good plan, thanks Bos'un.",
"Sounds like a good plan, thanks Nigel.",
"I shall now go to the ship and just be a member of the crew.",
"Ok, see you onboard.",
"20 000 gold coins captain.",
"Very good, welcome to the crew.",
"Thank you for slaying my owners. I wish to sail for you, free of charge!",
"Done, I may have more use for you later.",
