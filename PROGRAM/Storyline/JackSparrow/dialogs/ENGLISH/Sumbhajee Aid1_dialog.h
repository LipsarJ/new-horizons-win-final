"Thanks again for what you've done, ",
".",
"Don't mention it.",
"You are wasting your time, that is Sri Sumbhajee Angria and he speaks to no one. If you're looking for company, talk to somebody else!",
"As you wish.",
"Is that a way to greet a great sea captain like myself?",
"What do you want?!",
"Nothing.",
"Let's talk about your brother.",
"Oh, thank you! Thank you! I've seen my brother finally! I'm so sorry I have nothing to reward you with, but me and Sri Sumbhajee are most grateful for you helping us...",
"(THINKS: Hmmmm. Sri Sumbhajee's gun is lying on the table maybe I could take that as payment)",
"...My brother and I have been Sri Sumbhajee's aids for a long time now and we both do not know what we would do without Pusasn.",
"(Picks up gun during speech) It was no trouble... Really.",
"Really?! One of those prim and proper sea captains then? We have no business with your kind.",
"Suit yourself then. I am prim, proper and proud to be so! You two should really sit alone for a while.",
"Are you sure you are referring to me? I have been accused of many things, but being prim and proper was not one of them!",
"You cannot be trusted. None of you! None that loyally serve their respective nations without regard for what truly matters.",
"What kind of talk is that? Are you telling me you do not approve of those who claim to be 'respectable'?",
"Indeed we do not! We deal with Brethren of the Coast only and nobody else.",
"Good thing that I am in fact a member of the Brotherhood myself. You can trust me as much as any one of them.",
"'Respectable' indeed! There are only very few we might trust and even those may stab us in the back if given the chance. But you are not one of them!",
"This is beginning to sound very familiar. You must be a member of the Brethren of the Coast! I have been considering joining them at the pirate settlement on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. You may hear from me again.",
"Very well, then. My twin brother and Sri Sumbhajee's other aid, ",
"Sumbhajee Aid2",
", a modest, trusting man who just does his job...",
"Let me guess - This has something to do with the Spanish?",
"Yes! A Spanish Lieutenant.",
"Bernardo Gamboa",
" They have abducted my brother! I told him I was opposed to him dealing with him, but he wouldn't listen to me, and 3 days ago he disappeared! \nI'm sure that the Spanish Lieutenant took him! He owed them money that Sri Sumbhajee could not pay.",
"Why don't you turn to the officials for help?",
"Turn to the officials? Oh, dear boy, you are deceived. The snake that took my brother counts all the officials among his friends!",
"I see. Well, I hope there is a happy ending to your tale.",
"Perhaps I can help. Where can I find this lad?",
"His ship is in port. You'll have no problem finding it.",
"I'll see what I can do.",
"Go away, I've told you everything! Don't torment me with your questions!",
"Very well, go on, drink your rum and hope your brother comes back to you.",
"Easy, easy. Tell me where I can find the man who kidnapped your brother.",
"I'll see what I can do. (THINKS: Perhaps I should change into my Spanish uniform and go to the jail).",
