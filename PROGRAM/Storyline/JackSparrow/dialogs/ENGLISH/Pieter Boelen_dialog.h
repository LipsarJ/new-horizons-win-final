"Good day to you. Might I inquire as to who you are?",
"I'm ",
", captain of the ",
"I am Pieter Boelen, Dutch privateer and captain of the lovely ship, the 'Amsterdam'. Pleased to meet you.",
"So what brings you to this pirate-infested town today?",
"I make a point of helping all honest pirates in this archipelago. This time there are some rumours that the #sSantiago# governor is planning some sort of action against this colony. I'm trying to find out if there is some truth to that. You could help me if you like and earn some money along the way as well.",
"Money? I'm all ears, captain. What do you want me to do?",
"I can't leave this island in case the attack comes while I'm away. I must remain here to defend my friends. However, it would be possible for you to visit #sSantiago# to find out if there is some truth to the rumour.",
"I'd need to hoodwink a #sSantiago# official into giving me that information. That seems like a pretty dangerous mission. They could have me hanged for spying if I'm found out.",
"It's up to you. I'll give you 20000 gold coins if you succeed. Take it or leave it.",
"Very well. We have an accord. I don't mind a bit of danger.",
"I'm sorry. This seems much to perilous for me. I wish you the best of luck defending this colony.",
"Excellent! I hope to hear from you soon. And be careful.",
"Don't worry; I will be. See you in a couple of days.",
"Ah! You're here! Have you found out what the Spanish governor is planning?",
"Yes, I did. Bad news, I'm afraid. The governor of #sSantiago# intends to take over control of this island. His attack will come within the next couple of days.",
"Indeed. Please take your men and go to the lighthouse to prevent the enemy from landing there when they arrive. I will take care of the defence of the port with my trusted ship and crew.",
"Ok. I'll leave right now and prepare a warm welcome for our guests. Good luck to you!",
"AAHHH!! There you are! Have you succeeded?",
"Indeed I have! Let this be a lesson to them Spanish. The pirates will remain free!",
"Excellent, captain! We have been able to prevent them from landing at the port as well. Unfortunately my beautiful ship, the 'Amsterdam', has been damaged during the battle and I can't risk sailing out with her until we've made some repairs. We can't be sure if the Spanish won't try again though, but we CAN be sure that if they try again, they'll bring a much larger fleet. I'll need some assistance from the #sTortuga# pirates. Can you take me there while my ship is being repaired?",
"Sure. No problem. I will be honoured to have you as a guest aboard my ship.",
"Thanks for your help, captain. Your assistance has been decisive. We couldn't have done it without you. You did much more than you bargained for, so it's only fair that I raise your reward. What do you say to 40000 gold coins?",
"Oh! That is most kind of you. I have other things to do now, but I'm sure that with the help of the #sTortuga# pirates, you will be able to fend off any Spanish attack. I will take my leave of you now, but I hope we will meet again some day. Goodbye and good luck, Pieter!",
"Good day to you Captain. Might I be so bold as to ask your name, and why you are in the company of an English officer?",
"My name is ",
", and this officer and I are just returning from a mission to the French. And you are Captain Pieter Boelen I believe, Captain of the 'Amsterdam'.",
"Yes I am, but you have aroused my curiosity, an English officer on a mission with the French? That doesn't sound very likely, unless he is a traitor?",
"Oh no Captain Boelen, he is no traitor. He was representing his Government on a matter of the utmost secrecy. Which is why, in fact, we are here.",
"Now that sounds like the overture to a request for money Captain ",
", and that does not please me.",
"Not so Captain. Far from it. You see, I know of your reputation for helping honest pirates and I think I might be of some assistance in that respect, being an honest pirate myself.",
"Your English Captain looks as if he is about to choke. Is he not well?",
"Oh! he is fine. He hasn't done much sailing though, so he may be a little seasick from our journey.",
"Very well. So if it isn't money you are after, what is this assistance you could provide?",
"The French paid the English to allow them to reprovision at their islands. I believe that they intend to turn on the pirates.",
"As to the French turning on us we knew that would happen. But, not so soon. What proof do you have of your claim?",
"How about 100,000 in gold which we were paid by the French?",
"Good Heavens! are you SURE your English Captain is well? He is going quite purple!",
"Yes, Yes... weak stomachs run in his family.",
"Hmmm. So you would give us 100,000 in gold and advance warning of a French attack. What do you want in return?",
"To ensure the safety of the pirates home island is all that I look for.",
"Very Noble Captain ",
", very noble indeed. Oh Dear! You should look to your English Captain. He appears to have fainted.",
"Ah! Yes. I suppose I should, but in the meantime, here is the money. What do you intend to do?",
"Oh! I think we can surprise the French a little ourselves, and with the money we can have the best equipment. I don't think that they will make it into the archipelago.",
"Good luck Captain Boelen. Let's hope we meet again one day.",
"Ah! Captain ",
", you are back, and at a very opportune moment, I must confess.",
"What do you mean?",
"Our main pirate fleet has sailed to engage the French, thanks to your warning. But I have now received news that the #sSantiago# governor is planning some sort of action against this colony. I'm trying to find out if there is some truth to that or not.",
"Let me guess, you need me to sail to #sSantiago# and find some official there, and see if it is true or not, correct?",
"You are very astute Captain, as I had guessed from our previous meeting. We will pay you 20000 in gold for your trouble. Will you take this mission for us?",
"I regret I can't right now. I must continue with equiping my ship to be ready for the French attack.",
