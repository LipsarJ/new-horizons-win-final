"Do you like my latest uniform?",
"Yes, captain.",
"I'd recognize that face anywhere.",
"Oh really?",
"Yes, you're a ",
", or I'm not Thomas the Terror, the best dressed captain in the Caribbean.",
"Captain ",
", if you don't mind.",
"I'll remember that. So you're the son of Teague, eh? What brings you to these waters?", 
"I'd prefer not to discuss the family relationships for the moment. I'm thinking of going to #sOxbay# to see what business I can drum up there.",
"#sOxbay#, eh? Well, that's a coincidence. I'm on my way there myself, the tailor has just received some new material from France which I am interested in, for a new uniform I'm designing. Perhaps we could travel together.",
"You seem very calm. From what I've been told, the whole Caribbean is about to explode.",
"Ah! You've spoken to Tia Dalma. I just saw her leaving the residence.",
"Not in detail, but I've just left her. [THINKS: Well, I nearly spoke to her... So her name is Tia Dalma.]",
"Yes, that's a deep story. How much do you know?",
"Not much. Someone or something is coming here and that seems to be the root of all the trouble.",
"Ah! It's deeper than that captain. Tia Dalma isn't all she appears to be. She was once Davy Jones' lover.", 
"Oh! And they had a lovers' tiff I suppose?",
"To put it mildly. Some say she is a voodoo princess and causes much mischief by putting curses on people, including Davy Jones. It's all pretty murky. The Brotherhood did something to her and that has her pretty wild I hear.",
"What did they do?",
"No one outside the Brotherhood knows and we won't tell. I can tell you that it is something she can't do anything about.",
"So is that why she went to see my father? To get him to change his mind? [THINKS: 'we won't tell' That means he's a member. So that's where he knows my father from. Hmmm?]",
"I don't know, I wasn't there.",
"True, and I didn't hear anything like that when I walked in.",
"So, you are no wiser.",
"Except that I know something's afoot.",
"You'll do well to keep that in mind.",
"I shall. But then again, I'm not a pirate, so it won't really affect me, will it?",
"Maybe. But the pirates affect the whole area and what goes on, one way or another. So you may get drawn in anyway.",
"Hmmm! I can see how this could prove to be a nuisance.",
"Well, enough of this doom and gloom. Shall we sail for #sOxbay#? Two ships together will stand less chance of being attacked.",
"Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I'll meet you in the port.",
"Oh! Before I forget. Here's a little memento of our trip. It might come in handy.",
"Duly noted. Thanks.",
"Well, I'll leave you now, Captain ",
", I need to get to the tailors.", 
"Goodbye, captain. Thanks for your help.",
"Good. The best course this time of year is, as we leave the harbour, sail East-South-East till we reach #sisland_Redmond#. Pass the island on our portside, then maintain that heading to #sOxbay#.",
"Hello again Captain. What brings you to this fair island?",
"Hello Thomas. I'm on a mission. It seems that one of the EITC's officers hast been captured by the Spanish, and I've been sent to try to get him back.",
"Ah! I heard about that. Somewhat unusual circumstances surrounding that issue.",
"Unusual circumstances? What do you mean by that?",
"I don't want to talk about it here. Too many eyes and ears about. What I can tell you, is that you have two choices.",
"And they are?",
"The easy way, buy him back from the Governor, about 20,000 in gold should do it, or the hard way, rescue him yourself.", 
"I think I'll raise the money and buy him back.",
"I'm up for the challenge. How do I go about rescuing him?",
"Very well captain, you'll not be needing my assistance in that case. I bid you farewell. I hear the tailor has just received some fine silk.",
"We need to join forces. He slipped out of the the jail two nights ago, but I know where he is hiding. Make sure you're kitted out for a fight, Then meet me outside the blacksmith's shop.",
"Red looks good on you Captain. Let's hope it won't end up being your blood. I take it you're ready?",
"Yes, I'm ready. Where are we going to meet him?",
"You always ask questions in the most inopportune places. Not here. We need to go into the jungle, just go through that gate and keep going straight, but be prepared for a fight.",
"Fighting is my middle name. Let's go.",
"Just a minute. It won't be that easy, we can't take him through the town, the guards are on the lookout for him. Look we will go back, get your ship and you can pick him up from the beach.",
"Good thinking Thomas. Wait here Lieutenant, I should only be a few hours. Let's get back to the ship then.",
"Hang on Jack. I'm going to leave you here, I have things to do. It's Oyster Beach you want, you know that don't you?",
"Very well Thomas, I understand. Thanks again for your help. Goodbye for now.",
"Thank you, Thomas."
