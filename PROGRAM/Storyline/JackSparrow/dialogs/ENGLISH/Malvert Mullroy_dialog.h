"I know that ship, they say no one can catch her. But then there's them that says she ain't a real ship.",
"Ah! She's real all right, sort of. But the Interceptor here is really fast is she?",
"Oh yes, she's the fastest all right. And don't you keep edging towards her.. you're not allowed there mate.",
"Oh! sorry... It's just that she's such a pretty boat, er ship.",
"What's your purpose in #sRedmond#, Mr. Smith?",
"I..",
"I think he's telling the truth.",
"_",
"'Ere, What's your name then?",
"Smith, or Smithy, if you like. ",
" ",
".",
"Blimey! It's a miracle she missed the rocks.",
"Will you be saving her then?",
"I can't swim.",
"!",
"No Captain. You must free the slaves.",
"How do I do that?",
"By killing the three guards just around the corner from the beach. They are blocking my way to the jail where the slaves are being held,... and by the way, your crew may not help you.",
"Why do I get the feeling that you could do that on your own, and that you don't need my help?",
"Wisdom raises its head again Captain. You are correct, I don't need your help, but I do need you to prove your words by deeds.",
"Why is that?",
"Do the deed Captain, then return to me here and I will give you the answer.",
"I am getting into something deep here I know, but, I don't like the idea of slaves, so I will return shortly.",
"You were successful Captain.",
"Yes, I was able to...",
"That was a statement not a question Captain ",
", you have confirmed your character to me and proved yourself, so now I have something special that you must buy from me.",
"I kill three men and you want to sell me something?",
"No Captain, this is no ordinary sale. Give me 500 in gold so I can bribe the jailer and get passage for the slaves away from here to safety, and you get this compass.",
"A compass! I already have a compass.",
"Not a compass like this one. This one will lead you to what your heart desires most. Follow it with care.",
"You mean like the Chest of Cortez?",
"If that is what you desire the most, then yes.",
"Hmmm. That sounds as if you know something different. ",
"I do know Captain that you cannot return to your employer.",
"Ah! Yes. That will be a problem. Well, I do have somewhere else to go.",
"Yes Captain, back to the lighthouse at #sOxbay#.",
"You know about that too? Alright we will trade here is my gold.",
"And here is your compass. Your future is very complex Captain, but you should go now. Other guards are coming.",
"Yes I should, but what about you?",
"Don't worry about me Captain. I will disappear before they arrive. Till we meet again.",
"You mean 'if' we meet again... no you don't, you already know that we will meet, don't you?",
