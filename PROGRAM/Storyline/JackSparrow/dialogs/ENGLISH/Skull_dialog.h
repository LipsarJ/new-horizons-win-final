"I don't know who you are, but if you leave right now, I won't have to feed you to the sharks!",
"...",
"Who the hell are you, barging in here uninvited?",
"Sorry Captain Skull, I'm Captain ",
", and I have a business propostion for you.",
"A business proposition? Go on I'm listening, but it better be good.",
"It is, believe me. I hear you have some hostages and I would like to negotiate to buy them from you.",
"Do you indeed? You don't look like a rich man to me. The Brin sisters and will bring a tidy sum. A tidy sum indeed. Do you think you could afford it?",
"Ah! That is true Captain, but they will also bring a lot of trouble on your head, and my plan will relieve you of that worry. [THINKS: Sisters? I thought there was only one and a maid! Someone is not playing straight with me.]",
"And how will 'your plan' relieve me of what particular trouble.",
"Captain, you have taken the Governors daughters. It is one thing to hold a rich man's son. He has no choice but to pay you. But the Governor's daughters? The Governor will send the whole fleet, blockade this island and starve you out. Add to that the Excise Agent and God help you.",
"I didn't do the kidnapping, and it didn't happen from one of my ships. So, he doesn't know that they are here, in which case that doesn't seem likely, now does it?",
"Think on this Captain. The Excise Agent found out that they are here, and I found out as well. If we did it you can be sure that Governor Brin will, if he hasn't already.",
"O.K. Captain, you have my attention. How much are you prepared to pay for the hostages? And I want more than gold, such as some of those diamonds a little bird told me you are carrying.", // TALISMAN changed
"I think 1000 gold for each of the Brin girls and 100 for the agent. That makes 2,100 pieces of gold in all, and I'll give you two diamonds. [THINKS: I hope I can get away with this.]",   //TALISMAN changed
"I think you should pay me to take them off your hands. Think about the alternative.",
"You don't have that much gold. You've been wasting my time. Draw your sword you pipsqueak.",
"Very well. Give me the gold, and the diamonds.", // TALISMAN changed
"I will take your head off first. Draw your sword.",
"As you wish!",
"Thank you Captain. It was a pleasure doing business with you.",

"? So, the old fox wants my help again? Very interesting. Now, why are you still standing there? You've delivered the letter, so be gone!",
"...",
"Let me explain where you're wrong, lad. This town is mine. This island is mine. And everything that happens here happens because I will it.",
"So you're what, then -- a pirate chieftain?",
"I prefer to think of myself as governor of an independent colony. But I'm still waiting for your answer.",
"What kind of civilization do you have here, where a poor girl is just trying to find her lover and everybody immediately sets up a clamor!",
"Lover? Haha, you don't say so! Miracles still take place in this world! Why did he leave you?",
"Tell me, was he here? When? Where did he go?",
"He was here...making repairs after a storm. But I don't know where he sailed. He didn't tell. All right, take your leave now.",
"...",
"Ahoy matey! Well, blast me to Davy Jones' Locker if ye don't be havin' the makins of a true pirate.",
"That is an interesting idea for sure. And I must admit it is getting quite tiresome to have your band of brigands chasing me all over the Caribbean!",
"I make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates. Goodbye.",
"Ye be welcome to join our noble Brotherhood. But be warned that ye shall be hated by all the regular folk, just like the rest of us!",
"Naturally. We steal from the rich. And the poor. And keep it to ourselves. Can't expect to make many friends doing that. But that is part of the fun!",
"What? But I'm not THAT kind of pirate! I'm the NICE kind that gives candy to little children. Goodbye, you blackhearted scoundrel!",
"In that case, please be allowin' me to be the first to welcome you to the Brotherhood, me lad!",
"ARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!",
"Glad to see you can see sense, when needs be boy. Miss Brinkley go and collect the prisoners if you please.",
"Hmmm...",
"What do you mean, 'Hmmm'?", // TALISMAN changed
"Well... I do know you are about to get stitched up by your Miss Brinkley. In fact she only offered to come with us to ensure the safe transfer of the ransom so she could take it for herself, and leave you here with a worthless hostage. And worse than that, she will have associated you with the kidnapping.",
"So? I'm a pirate, we do, do kidnapping, and we are interested in diamonds! Yes, Miss Brinkley told me she gave you some. Do you still have them?", // TALISMAN changed
"The diamonds? Yes! As to kidnapping. It's one thing to kidnap a rich man's son, but, the Governor's daughters! ", //TALISMAN changed
"What's the difference?",
"It's one thing to meet up with the occassional English patrol... But the Governor will send the entire FLEET against this encampment, and how long do you think you could last against them?",
"Errg! .. You think too much mister. So what do you suggest I should do?",
"O.K. to keep you out of it, send my officer here with Miss Brinkley on one ship, and me with the Brin girls on the other. My officer will delay anchoring at Jamacia till I signal the transfer has taken place. That way we keep Miss Brinkley away from the hostages AND the ransom money, and then we hand her over as the kidnapper, and she takes the drop. You are free and clear.",
"Hmm... That might work. Wait here. I need to talk to my Miss Brinkley. I'll need to word it carefully so she doesn't suspect anything. I will also need something to give to Ines for the use of her room, two of the diamonds Miss Brinkley gave you should do. Don't worry! In exchange I'll give you a piece of an alleged treasure map that I took off a drunk the other day. HA HA.",  // TALISMAN changed
"Take your time. What use are diamonds to me [sigh].",  // TALISMAN changed
"I have spoken with Brinkley and she will sail with your officer on her ship. You will take the hostages on your ship. Everyone is waiting outside so you'd better get going. Oh and here is the bit of treasure map I promised you.", // TALISMAN changed
"Wise decision Captain. We will leave at once. [THINKS: This map looks interesting].", //TALISMAN changed
"Here, but why do you want the diamonds?", // TALISMAN added --->
"Well, I have to give Ines something for the use of her room, don't I! But out of the kindness of my heart I will give you this old piece of map. A drunk, in order to save his life, tried to tell me it was part of a treasure map. HA HA. I still killed him!",
"I feel I am being robbed, but I suppose I have no choice. Here, take the two diamonds.",
"Glad to see you can see sense, when needs be boy. Go to the port and I will have the prisoners sent to you.",
"You don't have any diamonds! You've been wasting my time! Draw your sword, pipsqueak!",
"The diamonds? No! As to kidnapping. It's one thing to kidnap a rich man's son, but the governor's daughters is a different matter! ", 
"Well ... I..",
"Do you know something I don't?",
"Lets see what you've got then!",
"Ok, here you are!", // TALISMAN Added <---
