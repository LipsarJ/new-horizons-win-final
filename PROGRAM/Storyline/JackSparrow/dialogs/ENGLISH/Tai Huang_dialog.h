"All right, fine.",
"Ah you know my name. Then ask 'em quick and get out.",
"Word has it you saw a strange corvette as you approached the island...",
"Yeah, that's right. A huge, black monstrosity with blood-red sails. Most of the men thought they were pirates.",
"They say that you are pirates - could this black ship belong to one of you?",
"These guys were nothing like us. All our ships are junks this was a corvette that looks really mysterious. I have a feeling it was heading towards #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Thanks. I'll leave you alone now.",
