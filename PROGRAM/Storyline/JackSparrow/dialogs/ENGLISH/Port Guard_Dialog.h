"Oi! Wait there sailor. You're under arrest you know, and lucky not to be in chains, as far as I'm concerned.",
"Charming! And it's Captain, by the way!",
"That's as may be. Just wait here until you're summoned.",
"What have I been arrested for anyway?",
"Doesn't take much working out in my book! I see a woman up there, in great distress, pleading to the Governor. I see a randy sailor here. Now, you tell me.",
"But... [THINKS: If i'm not mistaken, that's my FATHER up there!? What's HE doing here?]",
"You're in the best place tonight, the town is under attack by some pirate ship. They say it's the #scursed_ship#.",
"I thought I recognised those guns.",
"That's as may be. I've been ordered to the port to repel the pirates if they try to land.",
"I'd offer to come and help, but, being a pirate, I wouldn't know what side I'm on!",
"Who are you and what are you doing here?",
"I am Captain ",
", and I have just had the pleasure of being marooned here.",
"A captain eh? Know how to navigate a ship do you? Our captain and navigator died of scurvy and we need to get to #sTortuga#.",
"Ah! Scurvy! There's a lot of it about, but to answer your question, yes I could sail your ship to #sTortuga# for you. I'll need a sword though. No self respecting captain would sail without one.", 
"Good, here's a sword. Let's be going then. The ship's in the bay down there.",
"Lead on McDuff! Or better still, follow me.",
"We made it. We will say goodbye captain. We have things to do.",
"Goodbye, and thank you.",
"YOU! You are working for that damned East India Company. Correct? Don't lie! I have spoken with your crew.",
"Er.. Yes Sir. I came to discuss a matter relating to the Company.",
"Discuss be dammed! Prepare to die.",
"Huh!",
"I hear Sir Cutler Beckett has pulled his ship close into the harbour so that every one gets a good look at you hanging there tomorrow, as a warning to other pirates!",
"Charming!",
"You there! Come with me!",
"Well, I would rather go the other way, but if you insist so persistently...",
