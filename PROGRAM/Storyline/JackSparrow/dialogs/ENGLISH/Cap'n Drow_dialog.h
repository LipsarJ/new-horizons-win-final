"You need to move.",
"I agree.",
"Mings? What do you have to do with Sir Christopher?",
"It was him that sent me to find Captain Petros.",
"Did he indeed? And what is your message for Captain Petros?",
"Just that. - It is a matter for him, and him only, and I'm not prepared to discuss the matter further.",
"You have spoken to me a second time, now we are contracted to work together on your quest. The word SWIM is only part of the information you need. We need to get the rest.",
"Yes Captain, I couldn't see how that one part would lead me to a treasure.",
"It wasn't meant to. In case the message fell into the wrong hands, it has been split into parts.",
"Now you say it, that's pretty obvious?",
"Yes, perhaps it is. We need to find out how many parts, and where they are.",
"Oh! And how do we do that?",
"Ah! That's a little more complicated. Your father must have sent several messages with the rest of the information in those. Now, who could your father have sent letters to? Obviously within the family, he wouldn't have trusted anyone else. Who esle is still alive in your family?",
"Well, me, my sister Bonnie.. and.. My brother Blaze.",
"So there you have it. Your sister has received nothing, else she would have told you, so it is your brother Blaze you need to find to complete the puzzle.",
"Mmmm! So how do I find him? I have no idea where he went to.",
"The last I heard he was in Barbados. The problem with that is that it is an English Island, and there is no way we could just sail in there under the pirate flag, unless we had some help.",
"What help is that then?",
"I know a place a deserted beach on the south side of the island. I think this is a case where stealth will overcome force. All we need to do after that is find your brother. Do what you need now, I will meet you at the dock.",
"That sounds quite exciting. I will make ready to sail.",
"Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite a trip. We'd better get on with the matter at hand though. We cannot stay here long, the King's ships will soon be upon us. Let's head for the town!",
"Oh! Yes, I understand. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"That would be the obvious place to start.",
"Are we ready to go?",
"Yes, I have sent the ship to sea with orders to stay out of site of land and not to engage the English ships. We can signal it back in when we return. ",
"That sounds good. Let's go then.",
"So you're finally awake then. You were hit over the head and captured in the jungle. You've been here for two days now.",
"Well, you've answered most of my questions, except who did it.",
"We don't have time to talk now. The lads have created a diversion and all the troops have been called to man their stations, but it won't last for long so we need to get out of here.",
"Where are we going to go to?",
"Head for the port, board my ship and head for #sisland_Turks# Island. We've all agreed to meet up there. I'll watch your back as we go.",
"O.K. Let's get going then.",
"Ahoy, Captain Sparrow! What brings you here?",
"You do, Cap'n Drow. Nathan Kell suggested to me that you are a man that can take a great responsibility, I agreed. So what say you?",
"What is it that you want from me?",
"This bit of junk is one of nine pieces of eight! With it you will become the pirate lord of the Atlantic ocean. We are to honour the call, if this happens you will need to sail to Shipwreck Cove!",
"I'm indeed very interested. Is there anything I can give in return.",
"[THINKS: Maybe I can take something as payment while I show him where Shipwreck Cove is] Just honour the call, savvy? Here is where Shipwreck Cove is located",
"Welcome back, Mr Sparrow. What can I do for you?",
"CAPTAIN Sparrow. I was hoping to bestow a great honour upon you, Cap'n Drow. If you would be willing to do what it takes to earn said honour, that is.",
