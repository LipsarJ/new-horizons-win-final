"Leave me be.",
"Ok then.",
"What are you doing here? Leave me be!",
"Sorry but I'm Captain ",
" captain of the ship '",
". I can see that you have an officer of my ship with you, Capitaine Chevalle.",
"Yes I do, I'm Captain Eduardo Villanueva and me and your officer Capitaine Chevalle were discussing a mission.",
"A mission? Nevertheless, I'd like to know more details about this mission.",
"Well, I know that the Spanish discovered a big deposit of silver in the archipelago two years ago...",
"I've never heard this information. How do you know this?",
"I captured a Spanish galleon a few weeks ago. Aboard there was an official of #sSantiago# who agreed to give me this information in exchange for his release.",
"And you believed him?! Maybe, he only concocted this story so you'd let him go. ",
"Of course, I didn't release him. He's prisoner on #sTortuga# and I'll only let him go after confirming the information.",
"That was rather smart of you. Where is the deposit of silver?", 
"Well, he told me it was on a deserted island in the middle of the archipelago.",
"It could be #sisland_Battle Rocks#...",
"Do you know the way to go there?",
"Yes, I could take you there. I've visited islands around that location recently. It seems to be very inhospitable and it will be hard to find a location to moor. The coast is uneven.",
"If the Spanish have settled the island, I think we should be able to moor there, shouldn't we?",
"Yes, of course. And if your prisoner is right, what about the loot?",
"The stolen silver will be sold at #sTortuga# and we'll share the profits. what do you think?",
"Indeed, we could earn a lot.. Ok, I accept. I will need to sail on your ship though as I am currently in the market. When do we leave #sTortuga#?",
"Indeed, we could earn a lot.. Ok, I accept. I will be your partner. When do we leave #sTortuga#?",
"Well captain, maybe I'll see you again one day.",
"Maybe, goodbye!",
"Excellent! I've already made the preparations so we can go right now. But before, Capitaine Chevalle has more to say to you. He'll be useful during this expedition. Indeed, he is a good fighter!",
"Finally, we found a shore.",
"Indeed, I was right when I said the coast is uneven. Let's go into the jungle to see if the Spaniards have settled the island.",
"Now, we are so close to the goal, I'm not willing to give up.",
"Me too!",
"Dash it! He escaped.",
"NO GOOD! Now, he's going to warn the convoy...",
"We have no option but to attack the convoy as quickly as possible.",
"I think so. Let's go.",
"I checked out the boxes. They are full of silver.", 
"I love hearing news like this! Let's go to the ships. I want the silver under the protection of our cannons.",
"Well we made it back to #sTortuga# with all the silver and a new ship!",
"Not a bad expedition to be sure.",
"Why should you get the ship you French pig?!",
"Oh boy.",
"A French ship is no trouble to us, I would be worried about a Spanish ship!",
"...",
"The French can eat my shoe, Capitaine.",
"...",
"I know where it is, but I believe the mission is a fool's errand, savvy? I guess this is the end of your time on my ship, Chevalle. Farewell for now.",
