"Yes?",
"...",
"Have you brought news from the Stallion? He said he'd send his men. All of us have been waiting.",
"Yes, he sent me. But don't announce it to the whole town!",
"Sorry, sir. I'll keep it down. But where's your medallion, though? I was told to ask about your medallion.",
"So you didn't forget about the medallion, eh? Here it is.",
"No, no! I wouldn't forget! Never! Good, I'll go tell the others. When do we set sail?",
"Don't you know? I'll bet you don't even know where we're going, do you?",
"No. The Stallion hasn't told us.",
"That's smart. It's better this way. 'Foul whisp'rings are abroad', as they say. And where is the Stallion himself? We can't depart without him.",
"He went to #sGreenford#, on #sisland_Oxbay#, for a couple of days. Now that I think of it, though, he should've been back yesterday. He still hasn't returned.",
"Strange. I suppose our voyage will be delayed, then.",
"What? Why?",
"You don't seriously think we'd go without him, do you? I've got to go get him, or at least find out what happened to him. Only then can we sail. In the meantime, stay out of trouble, and don't go far.",
"Yessir. I'll have all of us ready to go when you return.",
"Good lad. I'll be sure to mention your good work to the Stallion.", // <-- edited by Cat for Animists Quest fix
