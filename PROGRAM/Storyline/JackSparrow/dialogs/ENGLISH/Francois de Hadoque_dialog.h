"OOhhh... My head!",
"What happened? Do you feel good?",
"You're not Spanish?! Who are you? What are you doing in this island?",
"Don't worry! I'm not Spanish. My companion Eduardo Villanueva is, but he is a pirate who plunders their treasure ships, and that is Capitaine Chevalle also a pirate. We're looking for a mine. That would have the silver in #sisland_Battle Rocks#.",
"You're right. How do you know this? The Spaniards make sure that this information remains secret.",
"It seems they failed. And you? Are you also looking for the mine?",
"This damned mine! It was the origin of my misfortune! I've almost lost my health there..",
"Could you explain better?",
"Well, the Spanish found the mine two years ago. Of course, the mine belonged to the Indians before. After the discovery, the Spaniards deported dozens of prisoners from their colonies to work here as slaves. Their fate is to die in this island. And believe me that some months of this life are enough to kill them.",
"So, you escaped from the Spanish.",
"Indeed, last night. But they were not the only ones. I met a group of Indians a short time after and despite this I also succeeded to escape from them, they lightly wounded me.",
"Humm...That might be the group we fought a short time ago. Could you take us to the mine?",
"Do you really want to go there? The mine is well-defended by a military camp. And you can expect to meet many soldiers.",
"Ok, I accept to take you there but on condition that you release my friends in the mine.",
"Of course, we would have done this anyway.",
"In this case, follow me!",
"Very odd! I expected more soldiers in the camp.",
"All the more reason to be careful. Tell me now where is the mine in order to release your friends.",
"It's near the camp. Follow me again!",
"Who are you! What are you doing here! Your name now!",
"My name is: GO TO HELL!",
"Hey! Francois de Hadoque is back! Did you come to release us?",
"Right! Time for working in this mine is over. But I thought you were more...",
"And we are! However many of us have had to go with the soldiers to the port.",
"What port?",
"The port where the silver is loaded aboard the ships of course.",
"What?! There is a silver train under way the port?",
"Yes, they left the camp one hour ago.", 
"Now, I understand why we fought few soldiers. Well, you and your companions go to the shore on the East coast. I'm going to try to catch up with the train.",
"Wait Captain! I know a short cut through the jungle to reach the port. It's still possible to join them.",
"Excellent! Let's go now.",
"Thank God! Finally, we are free! I knew that Francois de Hadoque would help us after escaping from the camp.",
"Indeed, your nightmare ends. Now, we need to leave this island. Any time can land more Spaniards.",
"I think we should leave now otherwise we might get caught in something. Let us go to #sisland_Turks# Island.",
"I think you might be right. It looks like they are about to start brawling!",
"What do we do now captain?",
"Get some of your men onboard and have them sail to our ships, we will meet them there. We will head back to shore and find the convoy.",
"Thankyou captain for sailing with me to #sisland_Turks#, and also for giving me this beautiful ship!",
"It was no trouble really Francois. How are we going to split the money?",
"Well, there are the 120,000 gold coins we received from selling the silver. How about we split it 50-25 between you and I, and the other 25 goes to my Brotherhood to help set up our base?",
"Sounds like a fair deal to me.. So that is 60,000 to me, 30,000 to you and also to your Brotherhood.",
"Yes, captain. Thank you very much for everything.",
"I'll be seeing you, Francois.",
