"We are sailing... We are saaaailing...",
"You really like that song don't you!",
"Who are you?",
"A friend of Captain Petros and Sir Christopher Mings.",
"And who are they?",
"Members of the Brotherhood.",
"Ah! So at least you are not enemies. What are you doing here?",
"Captain Petros told us to come and rescue a captured pirate. Would said pirate be you then?",
"Yes, though I am captured no more. Well I must say, that was rather splendid of him. Can you get me away from here?",
"That's the idea, mate, unless you wanna stay and enjoy the sights. This is the Caribbean after all. By the way, do you have a part of an old map on you?",
"I did have, but they took it off me when I was captured.",
"Bugger! Well it can't be helped, I suppose.",
"Yes, I heard some Captain by the name of Barbossa bought it off the guards. He has it now, so he must know something about where it leads.",
"Barbossa! Well, well. I have had the pleasure of meeting him.",
"What should we do about it then?",
"Nothing for now. Let's get you back to Petros first. I shall have the pleasure of dealing with Barbossa later.",
"The last I heard she was in Jamaica. The problem with that is that it is an English Island, and there is no way we could just sail in there under the pirate flag, unless we had some help.",
"What help is that then?",
"I will ask some other members of the brotherhood to join us. That way we will have a fleet of our own. We can either try to take the town, or land on a deserted beach. All we need to do after that is find your sister. Do what you need now, we will meet you at the dock.",
"That sounds quite logical. I will make ready to sail.",
"Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite a trip. We'd better get on with the matter at hand though. We cannot stay here long, the King's ships will soon be upon us. You are on your own now. Good luck!",
"Oh! Yes, I understand. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"No, no! I have contacts here you know. We are part of the same band of brothers, so to speak. You need to find XXXXXXXXXXX and mention my name.",
"Oh! I see. Well, I hope you all get back safely.",
"We will.",
"Goodbye, and thanks.",
