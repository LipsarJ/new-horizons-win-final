"The shame! Oh the shame of it, Jackie!",
"Er, but...",
"And as for the lady caught in the middle of all this... She ain't telling all she knows. Words fail me.",
"Your mother is distraught! Fit to be tied. Oh, the shame of it!",
"But it wasn't me! Whatever it was. ",
"Fit to be tied, I tell you! She's already taken a ship to Lord knows where, just to get out of here.",
"Jackie my boy, you ain't under arrest. It was a ruse to get you here because I need your help. Someone's stirred the waters in this here archipelago. That's the shame of it, Jackie! Life was sweet... We pirated here and there, but the Code and the Brotherhood is what held us together.",
"But I didn't do anything wrong! In fact I ain't done anything yet at all... Listen, I just docked here. The guards arrested me for Lord knows what, and marched me to this place where I meet my father. A father, I might add, whom I ain't seen since I was a lad. Why am I here?",
"I mean, that things that should have been left well alone, haven't been. I mean, that treasure that should have been left alone, hasn't. I mean that people who should have stayed away from here, haven't. I mean...",
"What do you mean?",
"No, Jackie. I called you here to say goodbye.",
"I get your drift. A lot of people have been doing what they shouldn't. So that's why you called me here?",
"Oh! Goodbye, then.",
"Not yet!",
"Oh!",
"Methinks the fates worked to place us here, Jackie. It's been a long time since we've seen each other. ",
"Aye. Since I pushed off from home, ten years ago, as I recall.",
"That be done! Our meeting here, now, on this island has been set by the fates, or by powers greater than we know.",
"Or, then again, by sheer coincidence.",
"There is much going on in these waters and I can see trouble brewing. The pirate life ain't gonna be the same.",
"Well, I am not a pirate, Dad. So it doesn't bother me.",
"That's another shame, Jackie. You disappointed me there... You would have had such a fine career if you'd stuck with me.",
"Well, I didn't. I have my own ship and intend to make my own fortune, in my own way.",
"I'll cut to it, then. Jackie, I need your help. I need you to stop what's happening. You can, but you will have to do it on your own, without me. You won't be seeing me again for a long while, son. I've the Code to worry about.",
"On my own? The Code? What code and do what, exactly? You are not making any sense at all, Dad. Tell me!",
"Sorry, Jackie. I can't. I'm out of time and need to get back to Shipwreck Cove. Matthew will help you. Goodbye, my boy.",
"Jackie, my boy. Is that you? Oh my, you've gone and done it, ain't you?",
"I feel alright. But everyone reacts that way when they see me. The men I was sailing with have gone to get a doctor from #sisland_Cayman#. But guess what? I've found the treasure of Cortez! So all in all good news!",
"A doctor won't help you Jackie, and finding that treasure isn't all you've done, is it?",
"You've taken the treasure, haven't you Jackie?",
"Only a few coins. And why won't a doctor help me?",
"Because the treasure is cursed and that's what's making you ill, so to speak. Don't you think we'd have taken it, if there weren't something terribly wrong with it?",
"But I told you I don't feel ill. In fact I had a fight with some rogue pirates on the way here. I got cut up pretty badly, but didn't feel a thing.",
"That's the curse, Jackie. You have taken the treasure and until it's returned, you cannot die. You're cursed to walk the earth forever!",
"Cursed, you say? That could be terrible... Or maybe not... But forever is a long time... I should get rid of it. What should I do then?",
"What I said. Put the coins you took back where you found them. Cut your finger, wipe the blood on them first, and when you put them back you'll be mortal.",
"Alright, I'll do it. By the way, what are you doing here? I thought you lived at Shipwreck Cove.",
"I do. I'm having a big problem with one of the members of the Brotherhood, so I came here to think.",
"You're not going to tell me who, eh? Very well, I'll go and put these coins back. Then I need to find the others in #sisland_Cayman#. I'll see you again, no doubt!",
"Stay safe Jackie.",
"I'll try. You too.",
"Well, well, Jackie boy! It appears you've been making a name for yourself: dressing as a cleric and a British Lieutenant? Rescuing damsels in distress? Very piratical of you, Jackie.",
"I suppose you could say I'm fully on the Account now, and throroughly enjoying it.",
"Yes, I can tell! Jackie, I am truly proud of you. Now, take this. It's very important to me, and now it is to you. Keep it with you at all times. It is the symbol marking you as a Pirate Lord of the Caribbean.",
"Me? I'm honoured! Confused, but honoured.",
"Let it sink in. I'd celebrate with you, but I must set sail to Shipwreck Cove now. I will see you again, sometime. Goodbye, Jackie.",
"Goodbye, Dad.",
