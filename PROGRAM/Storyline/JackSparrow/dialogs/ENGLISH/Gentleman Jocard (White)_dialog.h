"I'm Captain Jack Sparrow, pirate lord of the Caribbean. You are not worthy of that title, so I'll be stripping you of it, savvy?",
"Yes, I know who you are! You do not deserve the title so I shall be taking it from you.",
"You appear to have my slave captain. Please hand him over.",
"Not going to happen, savvy? I can't stand stuck up slavers, or any slavers for that matter. Prepare to die.",
"I am Gentleman Jocard, pirate lord of the Alantic ocean. Do you really think you can kill me?",
"Oh, the one thing you are missing is backup, my lord. Bos'un, Gombo, ATTACK!!",
"Hey you! That ship belongs to Gentleman Jocard, the leader of the slave plantation!",
"Yes, it... OH NO!",
"You either stole it, or killed him and took it. That is an act of piracy for which the penalty is death. You will be hanged at dawn!",
"Bugger!",
