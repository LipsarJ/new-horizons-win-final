"Steady boys, steady!",
"Aye Captain.",
"So, you are Captain ",
" sent by Sir Christopher to help us? And who is your comrade pray tell?",
"Aye, Captain Petros I am, and this is the Honourable Lieutenant Peter Willemoes, Ambassador to King Christian V of Denmark.",
"Excellent! Excellent! You are both very welcome here. We have much to discuss, but I forget my manners. Let me introduce Captain Konrad Kulczycki who is our chief strategist.",
"A pleasure to meet you Captain. I have heard much about you and your work.",
"Ah! Yes, our problems. We are finding that we cannot agree with some of the actions of our fellow pirate brothers. In fact we have come to a point where our ways must part, however, given the nature of our business, finding, shall we say, suitable accommodation, is proving difficult.",
"Hard to find a decent shack, ey? I understand, few islands will allow your presence, being pirates and all that.",
"A good idea Konrad. Captain ",
" and I can discuss the overall situation.",
"Oh! And what is that?",
"We had three problems, where we could relocate the settlement, the money, and the fact that not all the senior members of the brotherhood wish to come with us.",
"Seems like Peter Willemoes may solve your location problem. Money has been a problem since the beginning of time though and I don't see what I could do about those who don't wish to join you.",
"You underestimate yourself Captain. You can indeed solve our money and brotherhood issue in one go. I believe you are carrying a compass and part of the map to the treasure of Cortez?",
"Er... Yes I am, but what help would that be to you?",
"I also have part of the map here, which you may take, and one of our members has a third part. Unfortunately he is presently residing in a jail on the island of Puerto Rico. Now, if you were to rescue him, we would be much closer to the treasure, and that would draw more members back to us.",
" Aha! That's more like it! What can you tell me about the jail situation then?",
"I don't think I'm ready for such an adventure yet so I will bid you good day.",
"I can't tell you much I'm afraid. All you can do, is sail to Puerto Rico and ask around. Be careful where you land though, they will be expecting a rescue attempt.",
"Alright then! I'll be leaving shortly.",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite a trip. We'd better get on with the matter at hand though. We cannot stay here long, the King's ships will soon be upon us. Let's head for the town!",
"Oh! Yes, I understand. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"That would be the obvious place to start.",
"Are we ready to go?",
"Yes, I have sent the ship to sea with orders to stay out of site of land and not to engage the English ships. We can signal it back in when we return. ",
"That sounds good. Let's go then.",
"Ah! Captain ",
", you managed to rescue Captain Charles. That is excellent work, well done!",
"Well, it's not all good news, the map was taken from him when he was captured. A man by the name of Barbossa has it, but I can take it back from him.",
"Small matter Captain ",
", things have progressed since you were away. It appears Captain Kell has another piece of the map, however, only Anamaria knows where he is. Now she is on lighthouse beach on #sisland_Oxbay# waiting for you.",
"Waiting for me? As much as I enjoy the thought, a lass waiting for me, how could she when she doesn't even know me?",
"Ha! Ha! That is true ",
", she never comes here as she is an agent of ours, but we managed to get a message to her to meet you there rather than in the town so she would know who you are. Now, if you would be so kind as to go and meet her and then find Captain Kell, we will be another step forward. I also need Mr. Gibbs for an assignment on #sTortuga#, so he will not be coming with you.",
"Very well Petros, I will go and meet her, on my own. Captain Charles could do with a rest for now I think. He seems to be missing the ship he is entitled to by name.",
"It is good to meet you at last, captain. It is a relief that both you and Cap'n Drow are safe. After Lieutenant Willemoes and Mr Gibbs warned us of your capture, we took the liberty of sailing your ship here. You'll find it in the harbour.", // TALISMAN ADDED --->>>
"Thank you Captain Petros. I am sorry I did not meet you at your plantation on Guadeloupe. I am not sure what actually happened there.",
"That was the work of a man called Mercer, he is employed by the East India Trading Co. and is very dangerous. We heard he had been talking to the Governor, but did not think the French would act so quickly!",
"I see, ... well if this Mercer works for the E.I.T.C. then that means Cutler Beckett must be looking for me, but I think I can handle that.",
"Are you sure, captain? Cutler Beckett is not someone a wise man crosses without careful thought.",
"Yes, he is no problem. Now Captain Petros, since you have met Lieutenant Peter Willemoes, as Sir Christopher wished, is there anything I can do to help you?",
"Ah, thank you I was hoping you would volunteer, for a small task, we would like you to go to #sisland_oxbay#. I believe you are carrying a compass and part of the map to the treasure of Cortez?",
"Er.. Yes I am, but how does that help.",
"Well Captain ",
 ", things have progressed while you were in prison. It appears Captain Nathan Kell has another piece of the map, however, only Anamaria knows where he is. Now she is on lighthouse beach on #sisland_Oxbay# waiting for you. We have also had a message from her to say that she has herself managed to get another piece of this map. So we need you to go and collect these two pieces",
"Waiting for me? But she doesn't know me!",
"Ha! Ha! That is true ",
", she never comes here as she is an agent of ours, but we managed to get a message to her to meet you there rather than in the town so she would know who you are. Now, if you would be so kind as to go and meet her and then find Captain Kell, we will be another step forward. I also need Mr. Gibbs for an assignment on #sTortuga#, so he will not be coming with you.",
"Very well Captain, I will go and meet her.",
"Thank you, I wish you a fair wind, and remind you to be on your guard for Cutler Beckett and his minions.",
"Don't worry Captain Petros, I can handle Beckett and his servants! After all...Who am I?....",
"Who!!??....",
"I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!",
