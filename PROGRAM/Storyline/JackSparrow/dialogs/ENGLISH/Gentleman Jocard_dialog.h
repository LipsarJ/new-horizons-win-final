"Thank you for not stepping in. I saw an opportunity to escape from my captivity and took it.",
"Yeah, I noticed you seemed to be very angry with him. Now I know why!",
"Yeah, I noticed you seemed to be very angry with him. Now I know why!",
"It's true. I was a slave and was forced to be a worker on slave ships. He wasn't much of a seaman himself, to be frank. \nNot long ago, we took on a huge load of cargo, destined for an island none of us had seen before. The ship ended up beached by a storm. \nWe escaped, but the vessel and cargo were destroyed. The slaver blamed me for everything.",
"And now you want a captain that will pay you?",
"We haven't yet been introduced. I'm ",
". ",
"My name is Gombo, and I do indeed find myself grounded and wanting to sail as a free man. I'd be glad to serve with you, if you deem me worthy. I am quite a good navigator.",
"Thanks, but I've already got a navigator.",
"It's a deal. But please, try not to sink my ship.",
"What can I do for you, captain?",
"What?",
"Just passing by.",
"At ease.",
"Captain, these men are slavers... and they wanted to kill me for attacking their fellow slaver.",
"Yeah right! They wouldn't know of that yet. Why did you get attacked by them?",
"I'm afraid that's a secret, sir, and not mine to tell. I'm bound by the code of Morgan and Bartholemew.",
"I was heading to the plantation to free the slaves there and they stopped me. The only way I can see freeing them them is buying them. I know of a place with the money but I'm bound by the code of Morgan and Bartholemew not to tell.",
"That may be, but you're not exactly a pirate, and I'm your captain. And if you don't want your life to end all too soon, you'll tell me everything right now!",
"You make a good point, sir. I'll tell you all I can. \nSomehow, my slaver learned of a ship that ran aground near #sisland_Conceicao#, carrying treasure in its hold. We were headed there when we were shipwrecked ourselves. \nWhen you killed that slaver, the head slaver and I became the only men alive who know the way to this treasure. That's why they're are after me. \nI'd never tell them what I know - but I'll tell you, because I believe you're an honest man. More or less. The treasure is located on #sisland_Douwesen#. You can find the path to the wrecked ship under the waterfall.",
"Now we're talking!",
"Thanks, Captain. I knew I could count on you.",
"You're welcome. Glad to see you alive and well.",
"Is something else troubling you?",
"Yes, I've fallen into disgrace with local authorities because of this commotion...",
"Oh, don't worry, I think I can solve this problem.",
"Yes, maybe you can, you've... heh-heh... witnessed all this yourself.",
"Thanks captain for bringing me to the treasure and killing Gentleman Jocard.",
"It was no trouble Gombo really, I really can't stand slavers. I have dealt with them in the past.",
"I do have a few requests captain... I wish to be known as Gentleman Jocard from now on in honour of me escaping from his grasp and in helping you defeat him!",
"Of course, is there anything else Gentleman Jocard!?",
"What do you want?",
"You can see this fellow is not resisting. I won't let you kill an unarmed man. Drop your sword.",
"As you were, gents.",
"Captain, I was attacked by slavers... and they wanted to kill me for attacking their fellow slaver.",
"You make a good point, sir. I'll tell you all I can. \nSomehow, my slaver learned of a ship that ran aground near #sisland_Conceicao#, carrying treasure in its hold. We were headed there when we were shipwrecked ourselves. \nWhen you killed that slaver, the head slaver and I became the only men alive who know the way to this treasure. That's why they're are after me. \nI'd never tell them what I know - but I'll tell you, because I believe you're an honest man. More or less. The treasure is located on this island. You can find the path to the wrecked ship under the waterfall.",
"Yes, I wish to take his ship the 'Ranger' as a sign of this as well. Also I wish to have his personal belongings, not including his gold or weapon, I shall trade this ring for it. Can we sail to #sisland_Eleuthera# to free my fellow slaves, we can use some of the money to set them free.",
"Ok, I shall help you do this as well. I accept the trade as well.",
"One thing captain, the slavers in the port of #sEleuthera# will not let us through and if we travel straight to the plantation we are sure to be investigated!",
"How do you suggest we go about it then?",
"There is an entrance to the tavern through a cave. This way we won't be investigated.",
"Ok, if you want the 'Ranger' leave now go to the tavern and hire some crew with your share and then take the ship. I'll meet you out on the ocean.",
"...",
"...",
"Captain, not only have you lost me 5000 gold coins you have also removed any chance I had of freeing my brothers! You have cost me dearly.",
"...",
"Now that we have snuck into #sEleuthera# let us head to the plantation located just outside the city.",
"Yes, let's head to the plantation now.",
"Now that we have freed the slaves I wish to ask a favour. Can we sail to New Orleans and free the slaves there?",
"Um ha, Bos'un!",
"Why did you call for Bos'un?",
"Bos'un how much gold have we taken?",
"What are you doing? Bos'un why did you turn on me? That is my share of the gold!",
"You threatened my life, savvy? And you wanted me to do it again. Bos'un is joining my crew. Goodbye, Jocard!",
"Um ha, Nigel!",
"Why did you call for Nigel?",
"Nigel how much gold have we taken?",
"What are you doing? Nigel why did you turn on me? That is my share of the gold!",
"You threatened my life, savvy? And you wanted me to do it again. Nigel is joining my crew. Goodbye, Jocard!",
"Thank you sir for killing the guards.",
"Would you be the leader of the now ex-slaves?",
"Sort of. I ain't their boss, but they do seem to respect me.",
"Good enough. And how'd you like a new career as a pirate?",
"I'm free now, so I ain't working for anyone. Not even you.",
"I'm not asking you to. See this? It's one of the nine pieces of eight. 'Gentleman' Jocard in there won't be needing it any more on account of being dead, but he does need a replacement. If you take this, you become the pirate lord of the Atlantic. Savvy?",
"And what happens to the others?",
"You're going to need a crew, aren't you? And a ship. There has to be one somewhere around the island. 'Gentleman' Jocard won't be needing that, either.",
"So what you're saying is, we take his ship, we become pirates, and I become a pirate lord? If I'm going to take his title and his ship, I may as well take his name as well.",
"Sounds good. Much neater that way. The pirate lord of the Atlantic is still Gentleman Jocard, only now, that's you instead of him. Welcome to our Brotherhood! Now, go and find your ship.",
