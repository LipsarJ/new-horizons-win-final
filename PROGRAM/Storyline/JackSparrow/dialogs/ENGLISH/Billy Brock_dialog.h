"Let's sing a sea shanty togther!",
"...",
"Ah, here comes our gold, now! Come with me - we won't go far.",
"All right.",
"Wait here, and I'll bring our prisoner out.",
"Just be quick about it.",
"Cash and carry - that's the way we do business here!",
"Here's your gold, funny man.",
"Funny. Wouldn't it be a chuckle if I just kept the gold for myself and butchered you and your friends like the pigs you are?",
"Awfully nice to deal with you.",
"I'd be awfully glad if you'd leave.",
"What?! You don't have enough money! Trying to cheat us, eh?! Die!",
"Damn!",
"See, that's not so funny. I'd kill our guest before your sword cleared its scabbard. Then no one would be laughing.",
"All right, all right. Some people have no sense of humor. Here's your money.",
"Good Morrow! Good Captain, a penny I beg, or a piece of fine gold, or rum, half a keg.",
"Here's your penny my man. I hope it helps.",
"Here's a gold piece my man. Spend it wisely.",
"Somehow I don't think you are the poor drunkard you pretend to be. What is your story?",
"Don't waste my time old you rogue, you probably have more money than I do.",
"---",
"---",
"Ah! Captain, it seems you may be just the person I've been looking for.",
"Well, having now smelt your foul breath, I don't think I'm looking for the likes of you after all.",
"Indeed, and what makes you think that?",
"You had worked out, that if I really was a drunk, the landlord would have thrown me out hours ago.",
"Hmmm! Something like that, I must admit. So why have you been looking for ME in particular?",
"It wasn't you, in particular, but someone who is astute and has their wits about them.",
"Well, I think I might fit that description. So can we get down to business?",
"Very well. If you're up to a bit of risk taking, there is a damsel, shall we say, 'in distress' who could use the help of a strong young Captain such as yourself. Are you up to it?",
"No, I think not. The ladies always seem to get me in trouble. So I'll bid you good day.",
"Damsels in distress are a speciality of mine! What do I need to do?",
"As you wish, my brave captain. The lady in question has been listening to us talking, and she has just signalled me that she thinks you might be able to help her. She has just slipped outside and will be waiting for you behind the tavern. Go now, and meet with her there.",
"Very intriguing! I'll go and meet this mystery woman of yours. [THINKS: There might be some leverage in this.]",
"As you wish, my bold captain. I'll see you don't fail. Board the ship of the smuggler and to #sTortuga# you sail.",
"Thanks, I know this is going to be fast. Next stop #sTortuga#.",
"Jack Sparrow's Adventure is the one you have sought. Just jump in your ship and sail to that port.",
"I will sail there from here. It wont take too long.",
"A long journey my Captain, that's a good way to sail. I have given you food so your quest you don't fail.",
"Ah! Thanks. When I wake up I will be on #sisland_Turks# Port Jetty.",
"Good Captain, I'll do as you ask. To #sTortuga# you'll go, which is no easy task.",
"So I need to find Mr. Gibbs when I get there.",
"Looks like you'll be needing my help again, captain.",
"Hey! You get around don't you? What's going here? Nothing makes any sense so far.",
"Patience, captain, patience... This is not the place to talk. Let's go upstairs.",
"This better be good. And can you stop that drunken beggar disguise? It grates, you know.",
"I know you're confused, but we had to be sure you were the one for the job.",
"Job! What job? And yes, I'm confused.",
"You know why I'm here, mate. Can we get down to business?",
"Don't waste my time old you rogue, you probably have more money than I do.",
"I know why you're here, you know I'm the best. Just be sure that you meant it and haven't just guessed. Have you preset your levels, equipment and all? If not my dear Captain in the mire you will fall.",
"Ooops! Sorry, no this isn't what I wanted. Goodbye.",
"Yes... I am testing the waters. If you know what I mean.",
"So, my fair Captain, where will you go? Just tell me your wish, and I'll make it just so.",
"I'll stay right here thanks and see what transpires.",
"I need to test the Mutiny with Barbossa.",
"I want to start by going to #sTortuga#, where I meet Anamaria.",
"I want to sail to #sisland_Redmond# for the 'Grand Entrance' sequence.",
"I want to go with Norrington to #sisland_Turks# Island for the alternative CotBP quest line.",
"I want #sTortuga#, where I pick up a crew and find the #scursed_ship#.",
"As you wish my brave Captain, just slip past the fleet. Sail to the Lighthouse, and Barbossa you'll meet.",
"Thanks Billy. I'll try that.",
"As you wish my bold Captain. I'll see you don't fail. Board the ship of the smuggler and to #sTortuga# you sail.",
"Thanks, I know this is going to be fast. Next stop #sTortuga#.",
"Well, well, well... Captain ",
" in person. Persistant little barnacle aren't you?",
"Let's just say, I'm one barnacle you won't be scraping off, you piece of rotting seaweed.",
"Tough words for such a young'un. I suppose you've come to rescue these delightful sisters. Unfortunately it's reality time so draw your sword.",
"Your time has come Brock. Say your goodbyes.",
"I'd like to go to the return of the sisters in #sisland_Oxbay#.",
"I'd like to go to testing Dead Man's Chest.",
"I want to sail to #sisland_Redmond# for the 'Grand Entrance' sequence.",
"Jack Sparrow's Adventure is the one you have sought. Just jump in your ship and sail to that port. Don't forget dear old Henry, now that would be nice. To get the quest working, you must speak to him twice.",
"I want the first mutiny scene.",
"O.K. Hang on.",
"I want to test the storm scene.",
"Then sail to Lighthouse Bay from here.",
"I want to test Ragetti and Pintel.",
"Ok then, sail to #sTortuga#.",
"How about that church on Isla Cruces? Let me see it!",
