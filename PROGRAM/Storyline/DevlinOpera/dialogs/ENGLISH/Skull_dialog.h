"I don't know who you are, but if you leave right now, I won't have to feed you to the sharks!",

"Why are you looking for ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"?",
"That's none of your business.",
"Silehard told me you'd be coming. He asked me to send him your head.",
"Well, here it is, right on top of my shoulders. You're welcome to try and take it!",
"Ah! It's the valiant ",
", friend and hero to the downtrodden masses! What brings a noble man like you to seek out a villainous pirate such as myself?",
"Ah! It's you, ",
", whose ruthless and bloodthirsty reputation threatens to surpass even my own! What brings you to me?",
"I've come to give you this letter.",
"You're more of a clown than I would've expected. Just take this letter I've brought for you, so I can be on my way.",
"I feel as though I should be familiar with you, lad...but for the life of me I can't imagine why. Who are you?",
"My name is ",
", and I'm here on business. I brought you a letter.",
"A letter, you say? I'd like to know from who.",
"Why do you have to know who sent it? Why not just read it for yourself? Or do you need me to read it to you?",
"Watch your tongue, boy, or I'll take your head as a trophy!",
"Well, that answers my question.... All right, if you must know, the letter is from the English Governor, ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
".",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
"? So, the old fox wants my help again? Very interesting. Now, why are you still standing there? You've delivered the letter, so be gone!",
"...",
"Let me explain where you're wrong, lad. This town is mine. This island is mine. And everything that happens here happens because I will it.",
"So you're what, then -- a pirate chieftain?",
"I prefer to think of myself as governor of an independent colony. But I'm still waiting for your answer.",
"What kind of civilization do you have here, where a poor girl is just trying to find her lover and everybody immediately sets up a clamor!",
"Lover? Haha, you don't say so! Miracles still take place in this world! Why did he leave you?",
"Tell me, was he here? When? Where did he go?",
"He was here...making repairs after a storm. But I don't know where he sailed. He didn't tell. All right, take your leave now.",
"...",
"Ahoy matey! Well, blast me to Davy Jones' Locker if ye don't be havin' the makins of a true pirate.",
"That is an interesting idea for sure. And I must admit it is getting quite tiresome to have your band of brigands chasing me all over the Caribbean!",
"I make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates. Goodbye.",
"Ye be welcome to join our noble Brotherhood. But be warned that ye shall be hated by all the regular folk, just like the rest of us!",
"Naturally. We steal from the rich. And the poor. And keep it to ourselves. Can't expect to make many friends doing that. But that is part of the fun!",
"What? But I'm not THAT kind of pirate! I'm the NICE kind that gives candy to little children. Goodbye, you blackhearted scoundrel!",
"In that case, please be allowin me to be the first to welcome you to the Brotherhood, me lad!",
"ARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!",
"AH yes! Young Devlin was here, but he left for #sisland_Redmond# about a week back.",
"Oh dear! Is that far away?",
