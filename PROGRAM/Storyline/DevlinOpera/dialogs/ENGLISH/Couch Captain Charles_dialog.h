"We are sailing... We are saaaailing...",
"You really like that song don't you!",
"So, you think I might be able to help you on your quest?",
"Yes Captain Charles, if you'd be so kind.",
"Then you must contract with me to enlist my help. Remember, that I like to travel at sea a lot. Think it over, or talk to some of the others first, but if you talk to me again we are contracted.",
"Yes Captain, I understand.",
"You have spoken to me a second time, now we are contracted to work together on your quest. The word SWIM is only part of the information you need. We need to get the rest.",
"Yes Captain, I couldn't see how that one part would lead me to a treasure.",
"It wasn't meant to. In case the message fell into the wrong hands, it has been split into parts.",
"Now you say it, that's pretty obvious?",
"Yes, perhaps it is. We need to find out how many parts, and where they are.",
"Oh! And how do we do that?",
"Ah! That's a little more complicated. Your father must have sent several messages with the rest of the information in those. Now, who could your father have sent letters to? Obviously within the family, he wouldn't have trusted anyone else. Who esle is still alive in your family?",
"Well, me, my sister Bonnie.. and.. My brother Blaze.",
"So there you have it. Your sister has received nothing, else she would have told you, so it is your brother Blaze you need to find to complete the puzzle.",
"Mmmm! So how do I find him? I have no idea where he went to.",
"The last I heard he was in #sisland_Redmond#. The problem with that is that it is an English Island, and there is no way we could just sail in there under the pirate flag, unless we had some help.",
"What help is that then?",
"I will ask some other members of the brotherhood to join us. That way we will have a fleet of our own. We can either try to take the town, or land on a deserted beach. All we need to do after that is find your brother. Do what you need now, we will meet you at the dock.",
"That sounds quite exciting. I will make ready to sail.",
"Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite a trip. We'd better get on with the matter at hand though. We cannot stay here long, the King's ships will soon be upon us. You are on your own now. Good luck!",
"Oh! Yes, I understand. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"No, no! I have contacts here you know. We are part of the same band of brothers, so to speak. You need to find XXXXXXXXXXX and mention my name.",
"Oh! I see. Well, I hope you all get back safely.",
"We will.",
"Goodbye, and thanks.",
