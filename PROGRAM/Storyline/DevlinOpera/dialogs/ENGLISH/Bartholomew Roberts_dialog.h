"Welcome.",
"Thank you.",
"Aye count me in too! I've been so bored lately. I know Skull can't leave the Island, and as for John Paul there, he likes his independence too much.",
"That makes us four ships.",
"I'm pleased to meet you too, Bonnie. But what's this big sister bit? I thought we were twins? .",
"We are, we are! But you were born a minute before me! So that makes you my big sister! Ha! Ha! .",
"Ah! I see. I'm glad we got that sorted out. That then makes me in charge. Ha! Ha! So we have a treasure to find. Are you up for the adventure?",
"Oh! Yes. I've been waiting for days for you to get here. When do we leave and where are we going?",
"Well.. it says on the map we should sail to #sisland_Turks# Island and look for the pirate Short Jack Gold, and ask him if he wants to go swimming! That seems a bit odd.",
"It's code, it's code! It's got to be in code. It will work out when we get there you'll see.",
"I hope you're right, or we are going to look really stupid, going up to a pirate and asking him if he want's to go for a swim!",
"Don't worry so much ",
" it will all work out, it always does. When do we sail?",
"As soon as I've checked the stores and equipment we can be off. Once we are out of sight of land, we must remember to raise the pirate flag to be able to land at #sisland_Turks# Island.",
"See, See! I said it was code. Oh! this is getting more exciting by the minute! And we'll get to see Blaze again!",
"Calm down, calm down! We haven't found him yet. [THINKS:] Little sisters!",
