"I feel that I've known you all your life.",
"Er... Thank you. I think...",
"I heard, I heard. I wasn't asleep. So you need to know the meaning of SWIM do you?",
"Yes Sir Christopher, if you'd be so kind.",
"Then you must contract with me to enlist my help. Think it over, or talk to some of the others first, but if you talk to me again we are contracted.",
"Yes Sir Christopher, I understand.",
"You have spoken to me a second time, now we are contracted to work together on your quest. Firstly the matter of the word SWIM. That is your initial concern, Correct?",
"Yes Sir Christopher, I cannot see how it would lead me to a treasure.",
"It is the part of an island you must search. The first two letters 'SW' mean South West.",
"Now you say it, that's pretty obvious. And what does IM mean?",
"Isla de Muerte",
"Oh! And where is that?",
"Ah! That's a little more complicated me dear. That island has always been shrouded in some mystery. Your father must have sent a second message with the rest of the information in that, so if one message were intercepted, it wouldn't help without the other. Now, who could your father have sent letters to? Obviously within the family, he wouldn't have trusted anyone else.",
"Well, me, my sister Bonnie.. and.. My brother Blaze.",
"So there you have it. Your sister has received nothing, else she would have told you, so it is your brother Blaze you need to find to complete the puzzle.",
"Mmmm! So how do I find him? I have no idea where he went to.",
"The last I heard he was on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. I would try there first, in fact I am in need of some sea air, so I will accompany you there myself.",
"I see, Thank you Sir Christopher. There is one more thing.",
"Not now me dear! Not now. I am in need of a nap. You go and refit or whatever you need to do, and I will meet you in the port when you are ready to leave.",
"Oh! Well, thank you anyway.",
"Whoa! I nearly dozed off there! Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite an invigorating trip. I always sleep better at sea.",
"I'm glad you enjoyed it. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"No, no! I have contacts here you know. We are part of the same band of brothers, so to speak. We will go straight to the head man in the residence.",
"Oh! That sounds good. We should get better information there at least.",
"We need to get a move on, we've work to do.",
"Don't you need a nap first?",
"Let me help me dear, after all I do know these gentlemen personally.",
"Yes, but..",
"Gentlemen! I crave your indulgence. On a matter of honour, the Brotherhood is obliged to assist this young lady in the search for her brother.",
"We have been given to believe that he is here on your island.",
"But what! Me dear?",
"You haven't told them his name!",
"Oh! I'm sure I did me dear, I'm sure I did.",
"You didn't! His name is Blaze Devlin, gentlemen.",
"#sisland_Redmond# you say! Damn and Blast!, (your pardon, me dear), That's a Spanish island!",
"Oh dear!",
"And, as good as my old tub is, she'd be hard pressed against a fleet of His Most Catholic Majesty's navy ships!",
"Well me hearties! I think that will do it. Let's get our ships sorted and be on our way to #sisland_Redmond#. With this fleet we will be able to deal with any Spanish patrol we meet and I know of a beach where we can land, not far from the town.",
"That sounds like a good idea!",
