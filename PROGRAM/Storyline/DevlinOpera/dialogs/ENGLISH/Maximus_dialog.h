"Busy, busy, busy... Busy, busy, busy...",
"You seem very busy!",
"So, you think I might be able to help you on your quest? I must be frank with you. I am very busy, but I think I could find time to accompany you on your quest.",
"Yes Captain, I realise what you are saying. If I accept your help with the quest, I will have to do most of the thinking.",
"Then you must contract with me to enlist my help. Remember, that I can come with you. Think it over, or talk to some of the others first, but if you talk to me again we are contracted.",
"Yes Captain, I understand.",
"You have spoken to me a second time, now we are contracted to work together on your quest. The word SWIM is, in the code we used, in reverse.",
"You mean as walk is to run, then swim would be to sink? .",
"No, not that sort of reverse. In fact that would be opposite. In reverse SWIM becomes MIWS. That is the coded word we must examine.",
"Now you say it, that's pretty obvious?",
"Yes, perhaps it is.",
"So how do we examine MIWS?",
"WE don't. You need to know the code, which of course I do. I know most codes as it happens.",
"Ah! That is becoming apparent. So what is the code?",
"Well, consulting my personal code book, we get M which means Maximus, which means largest. I is Interrelatus, Westus and S is Southus.",
"Maximus Intrigueus Westus Sailus... What on earth does THAT mean?",
"It means, dear lass, that we must sail to a large island to the far south west of here on which we should find a relative of yours. A close relative, from the use of the word 'maximus' in the code.",
"But that could be any of the western islands. How do we know which one, and what relative? I do have a brother, Blaze, but I don't know where he is.",
"Your father knew what he was doing, of that I'm sure. So for the moment I suggest that we make sail for #sisland_Conceicao#, where perhaps we will find your brother.",
"That sounds quite logical. We will make ready to sail.",
"Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, we're ready. Let's get to sea.",
"Quite a journey that. It certainly swept the cobwebs away.",
"Yes it was. What do we do now?",
"Let me try my diplomatic skills. We will go and see the Governor.",
"Oh! You mean start at the top and work our way down. That should be interesting.",
