"Steady boys, steady!",
"You are sort of standing there like a rock!",
"So, you think I might be able to help you on your quest?",
"Yes Captain Petros, if you'd be so kind.",
"Then you must contract with me to enlist my help. Remember, that I am a slow and steady, but I can pack a punch when necessary. Think it over, or talk to some of the others first, but if you talk to me again we are contracted.",
"Yes Captain, I understand.",
"You have spoken to me a second time, now we are contracted to work together on your quest. The word SWIM is only part of the information you need. We need to get the rest.",
"Yes Captain, I couldn't see how that one part would lead me to a treasure.",
"It wasn't meant to. In case the message fell into the wrong hands, it has been split into parts.",
"Now you say it, that's pretty obvious?",
"Yes, perhaps it is. We need to find out how many parts, and where they are.",
"Oh! And how do we do that?",
"Ah! That's a little more complicated. Your father must have sent several messages with the rest of the information in those. Now, who could your father have sent letters to? Obviously within the family, he wouldn't have trusted anyone else. Who else is still alive in your family?",
"Well, me, my sister Bonnie... and... my brother Blaze.",
"So there you have it. Your sister Bonnie, has received nothing, else she would have told you, so it is your brother Blaze, you need to find to complete the puzzle.",
"Mmmm! So how do I find him? I have no idea where he went to.",
"The last I heard he was in #sisland_Oxbay#. The problem with that is that it is an English Island, and there is no way we could just sail in there under the pirate flag, unless we had some help.",
"What help is that then?",
"I know a place a deserted beach on the south side of the island. I think this is a case where stealth will overcome force. All we need to do after that is find your brother. Do what you need now, I will meet you at the dock.",
"That sounds quite logical. I will make ready to sail.",
"Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite a trip. We'd better get on with the matter at hand though. We cannot stay here long, the King's ships will soon be upon us. Let's head for the town!",
"Oh! Yes, I understand. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"That would be the obvious place to start.",
"Are we ready to go?",
"Yes, I have sent the ship to sea with orders to stay out of site of land and not to engage the English ships. We can signal it back in when we return. ",
"That sounds good. Let's go then.",
