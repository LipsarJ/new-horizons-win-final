"Welcome to our village, stranger.",
"Thank you. I am ",
"Welcome back, ",
"It is good to be back.",
"What would you like to talk about?",
"What can you tell me about the history of your people?",
"How do you get along with the pirates?",
"Nothing, actually. I was on the island and thought I'd drop by.",
"Our people, the Taíno, have been here for many years before the Spanish came. They said #sisland_Isla Mona# belonged to them. They had many guns so we could not refuse. They taught us their ways and their religion, which is why we live in huts instead of tepees.",
"Interesting. Please continue.",
"Fascinating, but I need to be going now.",
"The Spanish gave our people two choices - work as fishers and farmers, or work in their mine. Fishing and farming is easier and less dangerous so most people chose that. But the small island did not profit the Spanish much and in time they went away.",
"Now you've got me really interested. What then?",
"Ships from different big white tribes visited. They killed our people, killed our animals, burned our huts. Many people went to live on #sisland_Isla Muelle# under the Spanish. They did not live free but at least they lived. But some of us remained here.",
"Sounds like a hard time for the Taíno. What happened next?",
"About 30 years ago the English came. They built the port, the fort and the house in the clearing outside our village. They put huge cannons in the fort, threatening ships between #sisland_Isla Muelle# and #sisland_Hispaniola#. The Spanish did not like that at all and sent a mercenary to blow up the cannons.",
"I think I heard about that! Elting, his name was. What happened afterwards?",
"Without the cannons, the English had no interest in #sisland_Isla Mona# and left. Since then, none of the big white tribes have been interested. What is your saying? They have 'larger fish to fry'. So now the only visitors are people like you. Pirates, smugglers, people who want a place to hide from the big tribes.",
"And how do you get along with these pirates and smugglers?",
"The first time pirates came here, they attacked our village. We killed most of them and the rest fled back to the sea. But we lost many good warriors.",
"That must have been some battle! But you didn't attack us, so what changed?",
"Obviously things have improved since then. So I'll leave now, in peace.",
"When I became chief, I thought, perhaps next time they have more guns and kill us all. Or perhaps we win again. And then next time, and next time? So next time I went to the pirates with hands open in peace.",
"A brave gesture indeed! They clearly didn't kill you. What did they do?",
"So you made peace with them. But now I must leave.",
"We made a deal. The pirates did not want to take over the island, they just wanted a place to hide and rest. I said, if you leave our village alone, we will leave you alone. He liked that.",
"It can't have been that simple. What else did you do?",
"He repaired the places the English left - the tavern, the port house, the house in the clearing. We made some simple rules to live by.",
"I don't see pirates obeying rules easily! How did you manage to persuade them, and what happens if other pirates don't play along?",
"So now everyone gets along. Long may it continue!",
"The rules are VERY simple. White man drink too much fire-water, come to village, do nasty things to women - we tie him to tree, women do nasty things to him. Taíno drink too much fire-water, go crazy - white men shoot him, stab him or throw him off cliff. Beyond that, pirates respect Taíno and Taíno respect pirates. That's all.",
"A good deal for everyone. So what can you tell me about the history of your people?",
"You have returned my son to me!",
"Yes, he is a skilled warrior. If ",
" had not been with us, I probably would not have survived to be here.",
"Two Dogs Fighting? He'd have loved that! But that's not quite his real name.",
"Yes, I've been wondering. How did he get that name?",
"When a child is born, the father looks outside his hut. The first thing he sees, that is the name of the child.",
"So you looked out and saw two dogs?",
"Yes. But they weren't fighting!",
"I see!",
"Perhaps you have heard the legend of how our people lived in the land of the setting sun, and escaped a great darkness by coming here?",
"It sounds like old folklore and superstition to me.",
"Ah, but even the wildest bush springs from a solid seed. And even an old tale may spring from a seed of truth. You are a sea captain so you know that the sun sets in the west. And west of here is #sisland_Hispaniola#.",
"Are you saying that you believe your people came from there?",
"Perhaps. Before the Spanish came, #sisland_Hispaniola# was home to a great tribe, the Maya. They were powerful and cruel. They sacrificed their victims in their great temples. How then, if these Maya and their sacrifices were the darkness our people fled?",
"But your people can not build ships. They'd have had to cross in canoes or on rafts. It can't be done!",
"Anything can be done if one is desperate and determined. It would also explain why, when our lands were raided later by white men, many people fled east, to the land of sunrise, of hope, #sisland_Isla Muelle#; rather than west, to the land of sunset and their old darkness.",
"Very interesting, but I sense this is leading somewhere?",
"Indeed. I have a challenge for you if you are brave enough. Travel to #sisland_Hispaniola#. Find one of the Mayan temples. Find evidence that Maya sacrificed Taíno. Bring it here and our legend becomes fact.",
"And what's in it for me?",
"The eternal gratitude of the Taíno. Or, if you seek the yellow metal, the Maya were skilled in its use, so you may find material reward in the temple. And if you bring evidence here, I will find some suitable reward.",
"The temple certainly sounds worth a visit. And if I find what you are looking for, I will bring it here.",
"Go off into a jungle looking for a temple which may not even exist, just to prop up a silly tale? I have better things to do!",
"Welcome back, ",
". Did you find a temple containing anything of Taíno origin?",
"I found this. Does it mean anything to you?",
"Let me see. Ah, you have retrieved the ancient Weaving of the Ancestors! You have no idea how important this is to our people. You found this in a Maya temple?",
"Yes, right in the middle of #sisland_Hispaniola#.",
"Then it is proof that our legend is truth. And now for your promised reward. This bow seems appropriate...",
"A bow? I got plenty of those from the bodies of the Indians surrounding the temple...",
"Let me finish. This bow seems appropriate, along with this quiver to let you carry arrows more easily. You may also have this pot of curare and this pot of tar, which will make of your bow a far more formidable weapon.",
"Thank you. And now I must be going.",
"Can you tell me more about the Indians at the temple?",
"They must have been Akellani. White men sometimes call Indians savages, and for the Akellani they are right. I had thought the Maya wiped them out. But the Spanish may have wiped out the Maya first. And an animal whose predator is destroyed will breed out of control.",
"Sorry, what with the Indians around the temple and the labyrinth inside, I couldn't find anything that looked as though it might be of Taíno origin.",
"That is sad. Perhaps one day a more capable explorer will find the evidence to prove our legend. Until then it must remain just a legend.",
"Then it is proof that our legend is truth. And now for your promised reward. We took this from a pirate who tried to do nasty things to one of our women. It seems appropriate to hand it to a more worthy white man.",
"What have you done",
"? The soldiers already killed some of my people. If they return and believe we killed their men, they will destroy us.",
"Then you will have to fight. Perhaps if the pirates return, they can help.",
"How can we count on their help? When the soldiers arrived, the pirates ran away.",
"Because they could not count on your help. If you fight together, you can win.",
"Perhaps. But what is your saying? 'Actions speak louder than words.' If you can destroy the soldiers in the old fort, that will speak loudly enough for us to hear.",
"You have a deal. We'd probably have had to deal with the fort anyway, but now you have given me an extra reason.",
"Our scouts have told me that you have taken the fort",
"Yes, and we captured the French captain. But now we have a problem. More French are on the way.",
"It is as I feared. Your actions have doomed us all.",
"Not if we fight together. We can defeat them.",
"You have a plan?",
"Yes. My men will stay in the fort. You put a scout in the clearing. If the French attack the fort then the scout will tell you and you will attack them from behind. If they attack your village then the scout will tell us and we will attack them from behind.",
"And if they attack both at once?",
"Then they will be two small forces instead of one large force, and we will each defeat our share.",
"The Taíno have long lived in peace with white visitors. We are not warriors.",
"Sometimes it is wise to be as the grass, to bend before the wind and let it pass. And sometimes it is wise to be as the mighty trees, to stand tall and defy the wind. This is your time to be mighty.",
"Well spoken",
"! Your words have iron in them. We will indeed fight along with you. This day will pass into our tribe's legend!",
"That's the spirit. And now I must return to the fort to prepare for our next visitors.",
"That's the spirit. Now I must get my other ships away from here so that the French fleet does not ambush them.",
"Hold your weapons! I recognise this #sperson#!",
"Why are you wearing a soldier's clothes, ",
"? If I had not recognised you, my men might have killed you!",
"I need to find out what the French are doing in the port area. That's easier if they think I'm one of them.",
"How did the battle go?",
"Well enough. Thank you for sending your warriors - we were outnumbered and might not have won if not for their help.",
"You convinced me that this was our fight too, and it was our honour to join it. What do you intend to do next?",
"I'm hoping the French are just sending new troops to replace those left by the first frigate. If so, they won't know about the fighting, and if they think their troops are in position then perhaps they'll go away.",
"What will you do if that is not their plan?",
"I don't know. I'll make up something when I find out what they are doing here. But if I don't return, either the French think I'm one of them and I've sailed off with their fleet, or things have gone horribly wrong.",
"How will we know which has happened?",
"My men have also taken French uniforms but they're ordered to stay out of your village to avoid confusion. If anyone else in a French uniform comes here, I'm in trouble and so are you.",
"And then the French will destroy us, as I feared.",
"Not necessarily. Tell them you had no part in the fighting and it was pirates who killed their men.",
"The bodies on the path to the fort will tell them otherwise.",
"No, because my men threw all the bodies off the cliff.",
"That is not the proper treatment for the body of a fallen Taíno brave!",
"Ah. Well then, look at it like this. They fought and died along with my men, so they were honoured in the same way as my men. Their bodies have been given to the sea and their spirits have been given to the wind, to watch over this island.",
"It is still not the funeral they deserved, but at least you show respect. Very well. Then may their spirits give you good wind for your voyages.",
"And may they also watch over your village.",
