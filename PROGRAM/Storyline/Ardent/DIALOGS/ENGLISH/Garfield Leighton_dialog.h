"Arrr!",
"Well well, look what the tide washed in! How's the #sbackground#'s life been treating you, ",
"I'm surprised to see you back here, ",
". Word is you quit being a pirate.",
"You have a nerve showing your face here, ",
"! Half the people in here would gladly rip it off if they weren't too busy with their rum. I'd do it myself but I suspect you didn't risk coming here without a reason, so out with it!",
"Not too badly. But I need your help with something.",
"Doesn't stop me looking in on my old mates, does it? Besides, I'm hoping you can help me with something.",
"You're right there. But I've nowhere else to turn. I need help with something.",
"Ask away!",
"Why in the name of all the sea devils would I help you?",
"You tell me. What reason could I give to persuade you to help me?",
"Hmm... I might just have a job for you at that. But first, what do you need?",
"The ",
"daughter",
"son",
" of the governor of #sSantiago# has been kidnapped. I was wondering if you had any idea who took #spronoun#.",
"A #sgovernors_kid#? And you didn't kidnap #spronoun# yourself?",
"I did, and you'd be amazed how that turned out. But now someone else has done it and I've got the job of getting #spronoun# back.",
"Alright, I'll put out a few feelers and see what I can drag up.",
" Meanwhile, I have my own favour to ask of you. One of my men, ",
", got himself caught by the French and is stuck in #sPointe a Pitre# prison on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. And you're the great escaper, the first person to get out of #sHavana# prison under your own sail. Perhaps you can get ",
" out as well.",
" In return, you're going to rescue one of my men, ",
", who got himself caught by the French and is now in #sPointe a Pitre# prison on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. And you're the great escaper, the first person to get out of #sHavana# prison under your own sail. So if you have ",
" with you next time you come here, I'll tell you what I found out about your governor's #skid#. If not, you'll be looking for a new face.",
"Alright, sounds like a fair deal to me. #sisland_Guadeloupe#, here I come...",
"Patience, #sladlass#! It'll be a while before my men report anything useful back to me.",
"You're lucky I'm in a generous mood. Be off before you change that!",
"Alright, I'll get on with rescuing ",
"Welcome back! And I see you've brought ",
" with you as well. Now, as for your problem. Someone reported seeing a #sperson# matching the description of your #sgovernors_kid# being brought into #sRedmond# by a gang of armed men.",
"Thanks! I'll see if anyone in #sRedmond# knows anything more.",
"Well, you're back, and with ",
" too. Good. As for my side of the deal, someone reported seeing a #sperson# matching the description of your #sgovernors_kid# being brought into #sRedmond# by a gang of armed men.",
"Nice doing business with you. I'll see if anyone in #sRedmond# knows anything more.",
"Hey, Mary! Someone here you probably want to speak to!",
"Nice lady, is she?",
"Hello, ",

"> Pleased to meet you!  <To you>Now, what brings you back here?",
"I thought I made it clear last time that you're not welcome round here, ",
". Why are you back?",
"Another kidnapping. Someone's grabbed the envoy from the Holy Roman Empire and I need to find out who. Perhaps you know?",
"Why ask me? The scuttlebutt says you did it! Very bold, I must say, though perhaps a bit too bold?",
"Don't be silly! If I had taken her, I'd have sent a demand for the biggest ransom you ever heard of.",
"Funny you should say that. The scuttlebutt says that's exactly what you did.",
"The scuttlebutt is wrong, then. I didn't take her, nor did I send any ransom demand. But I'm in big trouble unless I find out who did.",
"Sorry, I can't help you there. None of the other pirates I know did it, and the pirates I don't know are small fry who wouldn't dare go after a target like that.",
"If it wasn't pirates, then who?",
"The Holy Roman Empire is the lead member of the League of Augsburg, which is basically everyone ganging up against France. So only France has a grudge against the Empire, for now anyway.\nPerhaps talk to ",
". He's the governor round here. Officially he works for France so he might have some idea.",
"Thanks, I'll go and call on him now.",
"governor's daughter",
