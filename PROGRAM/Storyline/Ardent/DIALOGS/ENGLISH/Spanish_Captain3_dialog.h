"So, you wish to steal my ship? Over my dead body!",
"I accept your offer. Draw your sword!",
"What are you doing on my ship? Leave now or I'll put your head in my cabin and the rest of you over the side for the fish!",
"Hold on, no need to be like that! I just came to invite a fellow captain to join me in the tavern. There's free drinks to celebrate the engagement of the governor's ",
"Yes, and I suppose they're being served by a mermaid!",
"Well, that's nice. I come here all nice and friendly. First you threaten me, then you insult my honour. Normally we'd be finishing this conversation with our swords, but I'm in a good mood on account of the free drinks. So if you don't want to go, it's your loss and your crew's. But be warned - I'm about to get my lads and head up to the tavern, which we're going to drink dry courtesy of His Worshipfulness. So if you want your free drinks, get up there pronto!",
"Alas, I have duties aboard ship which will prevent me from going.\n<To a crewman> You! Go to the tavern and see if they're really handing out free drinks, then report back here!\n<To you> If your story checks out, my crew will be along to beat your crew in the drinking game of your choice!",
"Now we're talking! That's the sort of battle which everyone wins!",
