". Whoever you are, enjoy your victory while you can. It will be short-lived. So will you.",
"I am ",
". What do you mean by that?",
"We are merely the advance guard. A much larger force is on its way. We expect it to arrive soon. If you leave now, you may avoid it.",
"What sort of force?",
"Ah, you would like to know, would you not? Well, I shall not tell you, no matter how you torture me.",
"Good for you, but it won't be me doing the torturing. I hear the local Indian women have a custom of smearing their victims' bodies with honey.",
"Honey? That does not seem too bad - it may even be enjoyable!",
"Yes, that's probably what the local ant population think as well.",
"Ants? No, please! I shall tell you what I know, which unfortunately is not much. I am merely a frigate captain, and not told of fleet movements or grand strategy.",
"Then what do you know?",
"The main force is expected within the week - possibly even tomorrow. I was ordered to clear the island of pirates, pacify the Indians, and clear some of the mess around this abandoned fort.",
"Yes, thanks for that - it made our approach much easier. But about this main force - I'm waiting for more information and the ants are waiting for lunch. You're going to satisfy one of us.",
"All I know is that the flagship is a third rate warship and that she has an escort. I know nothing of the escort. Do not give me to the ants, I beg you!",
"Very well. You'll be taken to my ship. Perhaps even a frigate captain can fetch a ransom.",
