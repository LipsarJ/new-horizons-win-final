"I like to meet brave capitans such as yourself and hear tales of their heroic deeds at sea.",
"Alas, I have not had such luck as the teniente who brought in a pirate recently. A female, too! You're not a pirate, are you? <wink>",
"Why capitan, surely you aren't afraid of me? <Flutters eyelids> Perhaps you are planning a bold voyage soon, then?",
"My 'Siroco' sails with the payroll for #sSantiago# in two weeks. I hope we meet some pirates - the extra security troops we're carrying will give them an unpleasant surprise!",
"You know what they say - be careful what you wish for, you may get it! But you are so brave, so I too hope you meet some pirates soon. Adios!",
