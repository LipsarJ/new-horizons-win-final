"Welcome to the house of ",
". Have you come on business?",
"No, just paying a social call.",
"Yes, I was wondering if you have any work for a captain with a ship?",
"Ask ",
", who handles that side of our affairs.",
"Thank you, I shall do that.",
"I'm here to ask about ",
"Yes, #spronoun# recently married ",
"But not willingly. ",
" was brought here by an armed gang.",
"Do you have evidence to back up this ridiculous claim?",
"Yes, a citizen of #sIsla Muelle# told me about the abduction. And I have spoken to someone who received a report of ",
" being brought here.",
"Rumours and hearsay, then. If you repeat this nonsense again, especially outside these walls, I shall have you charged with slander.",
"Then I shall have to get better evidence. And when I do, it won't be legal action which I shall take!",
"You are not welcome here. Leave now before I have you thrown out!",
"That would be a good trick if you could do it. However, I'm leaving anyway.",
"Where did you come from? You did not enter through the front door, I would have seen you.",
"From that door to the side.",
"Impossible! The corridor on the other side is half collapsed and anyway the lock has been jammed shut for ages.\nI am planning to get some workmen in to clear the passage. It leads to the old Inquisition prison, you know.\nI'll have it cleaned up and open it as a museum, then charge people money to visit it.",
"I've got news for you. ",
" got there first. The cells are perfectly usable, and right now ",
" is in one of them.",
"Nonsense! ",
" is married to ",
"Nevertheless, #spronoun# is in a cell down there. And there must be a key here somewhere. So either you give it to me or I turn this house upside down until I find it.",
"I tell you, there is no key! Wait, though... you look like the sort of person who could use this. We took it from the last person who tried to burgle this house. Will that satisfy you?",
"Yes, I ought to be able to open the cell with that.",
"What the blazes!",
"Allow me to introduce ",
", recently a 'guest' of #syour_kid#.",
"I shall not tell you. You probably intend to harm ",
". And now you will probably threaten me, so know this. I am old and my life is almost over, but ",
" is in #spronoun2# prime. If my death will save #spronoun3# then so be it. So if you are going to kill or torture me, get on with it.",
"No, I shall not do that. Your punishment will be to learn in due time that ",
" is not as honourable as you, and is unworthy of such devotion. Goodbye.",
"Yes, I hired ",
" as an officer and #spronoun# was kidnapped while on shore leave. And I have spoken to someone who received a report of ",
"Yes, I heard that there was a lot of wine left over after the party for ",
" and #syour_kid#. Perhaps I could buy it from you and take it somewhere where it will be appreciated?",
"Why would we do that? ",
" has #spronoun2# own ship and has already taken the wine to sell elsewhere.",
"Oh well, it was worth a try. Thank you for your time anyway.",
"What do you want this time?",
"I'd like to speak to ",
", who was involved in a French attempt to invade this town.",
"You had better be able to prove such an outrageous accusation!",
"Perhaps you heard the fighting? It was just round the corner from here.",
"That still doesn't prove ",
"'s involvement.",
"No? The gang came from your cellar.",
" The same cellar which leads to the prison in which ",
" was imprisoned by #syour_kid2#.",
" Anyway, the governor is convinced. He has already declared ",
" a traitor and issued orders for #spronoun2# arrest.",
"Even so, I will not betray my own son.",
"Even so, I will not betray my own daughter.",
"Then consider this. If I catch ",
", #spronoun# will probably die quickly on the end of my sword. If the Navy catch ",
" first, #spronoun# will be brought to trial and then publicly executed for treason. If you continue to stand by ",
", your family name will be forever disgraced. But if you co-operate then #spronoun# is a rogue element, outcast from your family, and the Downing name may survive.",
"What honour will I have if I betray my own son?",
"What honour will I have if I betray my own daughter?",
"Have you any other children? What honour will they have if you do not?",
"So that's how it is, is it? Very well, it seems I have no choice. But I'm afraid I don't know much. All I can say is that ",
" left on a routine trading voyage to #sPhilipsburg# on the island of #sisland_Saint Martin#.",
"Thank you. You have done the right thing - provided you are telling the truth. One more thing - which ship was #spronoun# on?",
"I don't know. We have several ships and I have no idea which one ",
" took.",
"Perhaps the harbour master will know. Goodbye.",
"Ah, hello, ",
"! You may be interested to know that we've turned the old Inquisition prison into a museum. The normal entrance fee would be 10 coins. But in view of your association with our family, you get the special rate of 20 coins. Would you like to visit the museum?",
"Yes, it sounds as though it could be interesting.",
"No, I have better things to do with my money.",
"Or I could just go through that door without paying.",
"It's locked. Only I can open it.",
"There's always the entrance from the dungeon.",
"Not any more. That has been sealed off. All sorts of criminals and thugs go down there and we don't want their sort in the museum.",
"Fair enough, here's the money - I can easily afford it these days.",
"Looks like I won't be visiting your museum, then.",
"Excellent! Wait a moment while I open the door.",
"This had better be worth the money...",
"Your loss. You can always return if you change your mind.",
"I may do that. Goodbye for now.",
"Welcome back, ",
". Have you decided to visit my museum after all?",
"Just go in and find the Inquisitors. They will make you feel... welcome...",
"Thanks, I think.",
