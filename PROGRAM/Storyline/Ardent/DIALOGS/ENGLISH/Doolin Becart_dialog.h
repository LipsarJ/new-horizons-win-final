"Bonjour!",
"Hello!",
"Bonjour!",
"Hello. Would you be able to transport me to Boca de Hubon? There's 50 gold in it for you to say 'oui'.",
"Certainly! I'm just heading back to #sPort au Prince#. Boca de Hubon is on the way so it is easy to take you there. But only pirates and smugglers go to Boca de Hubon - are you such?",
"You don't really expect an honest answer to that, do you?",
"Don't worry! I was just making conversation. I wouldn't report you to the soldiers even if you had said 'yes', they'd probably hang me for helping you!",
"Indeed. Well, here's your money - let's be on our way.",
"Well, in that case, yes. I'm the pirate who took the #sSantiago# payroll ship.",
"My, won't old Pierre be jealous! He often brags about the time he carried a pirate, but not so bold as that. Keep your money, but tell me all about how you did it. This tale will get me free meals for a week!",
"Thanks! And I'll be happy to tell you about the payroll ship, when we're on our way.",
"Alright, yes, I'm a pirate. And the thing about pirates is, we steal ships. Yours isn't much but it has the advantage of being right here...",
"Bonjour once more, ",
"! Would you care to buy some fish? Freshly caught, and cheaper than you'll get it from the store!",
"What sort of fish?",
"No thanks, I have enough supplies already.",
"Many types! Barracuda, shark, sea bass...",
"Sea bass? We'll take the lot.",
