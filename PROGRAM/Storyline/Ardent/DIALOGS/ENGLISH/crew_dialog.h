"Any orders, cap'n?",
"Nothing for now.",
"Are we glad to see you, cap'n! We thought we were all going to die here. But at least someone made it out, I see.",
"Are we glad to see you, cap'n! We were all stuck here waiting to die. Poor old Nobby snuffed it only this morning.",
"Yes, a couple of the lads escaped, got caught and ended up in the same prison as me. We escaped together. Anyway. ",
"If I'm getting off this island then I'm going to need to steal a ship, which means I need a crew.",
"You didn't think I was going to abandon you in this hell-hole, did you?",
"Now what, cap'n?",
"You lot go to the port and find something to steal so we can get out of here.",
"And what will you be doing?",
"I'm going to the tavern. No, not to get drunk! There's supposed to be a ship with a payroll leaving some time and I want to know more about it.",
"We found a ship. It's not much but it should hold us all.",
"Well done, lads! A small ship is good, we don't want to attract attention on the way out. We can find something better in #sSantiago#. What did you do with the crew?",
"We tied them up in the hold. We can release them when we're away and clear.",
"We slit their throats. We'll dump them overboard when we're out at sea - don't want the bodies getting washed up and found too soon, do we?",
"Excellent, just what I'd have done.",
"What now, cap'n?",
"You lot follow him. Make sure he doesn't reach the tavern, or at least that he doesn't get back.",
"Why?",
"Because if he reports back that the tavern is only handing out one free drink to each man, it won't have the effect we want, which is the entire crew of this ship charging off to get drunk for free.",
"There's a mob coming through the gate from the town, heading this way.",
"Probably the ship's crew. They'll be in a bad mood due to finding there was only one free drink each, and they won't be happy to see us either. We'd best get to sea now!",
"What now, cap'n?",
"Get someone up there as a lookout. The moment the 'Siroco' comes into sight, we need to get to sea - she won't take long to get into port!",
"'Siroco' in sight, cap'n!",
"Right, lads - back to the ship, quickly!",
"Do you want help, cap'n?",
"No, this is between him and me. If he wins fair and square, the ship's his. But if anyone else tries to interfere, kill them!",
"You did it! You kidnapped the governor's daughter!",
"You did it! You kidnapped the governor's son!",
"Yes. Now take ",
" to the ship. Intact! The governor won't pay if ",
" is harmed in any way, which means if it happens, you'll be taking swimming lessons from sharks.",
"Well, who'd have thought it? You getting married? Congratulations from me and the lads, cap'n! The rum'll be flowing free tonight in your honour, that's for sure!",
"Thanks. Yes, by all means go and have a good time. I certainly will!",
"Yes. Some genius put the prison right next to the town gate. Move the ship round to the beach, then we can escape through the jungle and not have to fight our way through the town.",
"The ship's ready to sail, cap'n.",
"Is ",
" back yet?",
"No, #spronoun# hasn't reported aboard.",
"Damn! Probably still in town. I'll need to go back and look for #spronoun2#.",
"Do you want me to look after ",
"'s ship until #spronoun# returns?",
"Yes, please do. But don't try sailing off with it!",
"Our ships are ready to sail when you are, cap'n.",
"Very good. More French ships are supposedly on the way here. Set sail and head for #sSanto Domingo#. But leave my ship where she is.",
"Aren't you coming with us?",
"Not just yet. I don't want to leave the Taíno to face another French invasion by themselves.",
"Not yet. The captain we captured doesn't know how many ships are coming, but if the French trusted a single frigate to take the island then it may just be another single ship to replace her. If so, I'll have her as well.",
"What if the new French force is too strong for you to take on?",
"Then we dress up in some of the uniforms we captured, pretend to be French, and sail out of here without a fight. Now go on, get out of here!",
"Good to see you again, cap'n!",
" The fleet's here, ready to join you again.",
" But you've been busy, it seems. You have ",
" ships with you. The fleet you left me with has ",
". I can't rejoin you until you've sold or berthed some of your current ships.",
"Very good, ",
". Thanks for bringing the fleet here. You can return to your ship now.",
"Good point! I'll go to the shipyard now.",
"You still have too many ships for my ",
" to rejoin you, cap'n.",
"Back to the shipyard, then...",
"That's fine, cap'n. I'll order my ships to rejoin you right away.",
" Meanwhile, I have to persuade the Taíno to fight along with us.",
"French troops are entering the pass leading to the fort, cap'n!",
"Good, about time! Let's hope the Taíno are ready to do their bit...",
"That was some fight, cap'n! Good thing the Indians showed up.",
"Yes, I will need to thank their chief. But first I'll have one of these uniforms. Get one yourself and have all the crew change too - there are certainly plenty of uniforms to choose from!",
"What should we do then?",
"Heave these bodies over the cliff - no point leaving evidence in case any more French wander this way. Then make your way back to the ship. I'll be along in due time.",
"Hello, cap'n! We were just on our way to see you.",
"Oh? How did you avoid ending up in prison with me anyway?",
"The soldiers were more interested in you than in any of us. After they got you, we ran off in different directions - I went into the brothel because it looked liked the nearest place to hide.\nWhen it was night, we all met up. We were about to try to rescue you from the prison but we heard a commotion and figured you were making your own way out.",
"Well, a bit of help would have been appreciated, but no matter.",
"Here, let me undo those ropes.",
"Take this knife. I managed to knock out the guard by the stairs but the one by the door is coming! Kill him, then we can talk.",
"Thanks...",
"Well done, cap'n.",
"Who are you anyway?",
"Cook's assistant, cap'n. When ",
"'s men came aboard, I thought to myself, this doesn't look good, so I hid in a crate. After the noises died down, I came out quiet like.\nThey didn't pay much attention to a cook's assistant. I overheard them saying they'd got you in the hold, so I told them I was coming down here to get something to cook. I walloped the guard with my frying pan.",
"Why didn't you stab him with the knife?",
"No good with a knife, cap'n. Very good with a frying pan.",
"Well, you're not cook's assistant any more.",
"Why not? What have I done wrong?",
"We can't have a cook's assistant hitting people over the head with a frying pan. Only the cook himself is allowed to do that. You've just been promoted.",
"Thanks, cap'n! By the way, your stuff has been dumped near those crates.\nWe're in #sPort au Prince# harbour. ",
" has sailed off to #sSantiago#. The other officers and the crew were taken off and are being held in the fort.\nCan I help you take back our ship?",
"No. When I've rescued the crew, they're going to be hungry and so will I. You're the cook now - look round here and see if you can find something to cook.",
"Hello, cap'n! Did they get you too?",
"Sort of. I was stuck in my own cargo hold! But I got out, with some help, and now I'm going to get you out of here.",
"How are you going to do that?",
"By killing any guards who get in my way!",
"I have a forged document allowing me to commandeer you as slaves to work for me. Just don't tell anyone that you already work for me!",
" Where's all your stuff been stored?",
"That thief #svillain# took it all! It's probably still on the ship somewhere.",
"Not to worry. If that's true then you'll get it all back once we're aboard.",
"How do you plan to get us out of here, cap'n? We can't help you fight, we don't have our weapons.",
"Let me do the fighting. You watch through that gate. When I've dealt with the soldiers on the other side, I'll go to the next area. Meanwhile you follow into where I've just cleared. We keep going like that till we're out of here.",
"Are we glad to be out of there, cap'n! We thought we were stuck in there for the rest of our lives, which probably wouldn't have been long!",
"I had my doubts for a while, too. Now, let's get back to the ship and get out of here!",
"How do you want to go about this, cap'n?",
"I'm going to throw a bottle of ether into that cave. With any luck that will knock out anyone in the cave - it should be more effective in such a confined space.",
"Follow me. We'll decide what to do when we see who is in that cave.",
"Get up there and see if there's a back way into the cave.",
"And then?",
"If there is, don't yell about it! We don't want to alert whoever is in there. Wave your sword about a bit, that will tell me you're ready. If you can't find a way in, get back here quietly.",
"If I do find a way in, what next?",
"Wait there until I'm inside. If you hear me yell 'NOW' or if you see the fighting start, jump in. Hopefully that will throw the enemy off balance enough to stop them killing the Electress. Now go on, up you go!",
"Alright, you can come down now!",
