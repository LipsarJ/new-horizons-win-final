"Got any rum?",
"Wait till we get you to #sTortuga#. You can have your fill of rum there.",
"Well, what have we here? I wasn't expecting any visitors.",
"Neither were these guards, and they're about to get another surprise!",
"What's the price for my freedom?",
"Don't worry, you're not paying it. Your boss is doing me a favour, so I'm doing one for him by getting you out of here.",
" is concerned about me?  Touching. But I hope you have a plan beyond getting to the door.",
"I do, and it doesn't involve waiting around here. Let's move!  But first, you get into that soldier's uniform.",
"Why?",
"Because the guards outside are hardly likely to let us out with you looking like a pirate, are they?",
"Stand straight when you speak to me, soldier!",
"No. Stand at your posts. Make sure the prisoner does not try to escape.",
"What did I just tell you? Stay at your posts here!",
"Come on, sergeant. We don't want the smugglers to get away before you have time to call your men.",
"! I haven't seen you since you got me out of #sPointe a Pitre#.",
"How's life been treating you, ",
"Not too badly on the whole. But I have news for you which will be best accompanied by rum.",
"Alright, to the tavern then!",
"You look like a free captain.",
"Yes, I'm ",
"And I'm ",
". Pleased to meet you, especially as I have news which is best told over some rum.",
"To business.",
"To business! Cheers!",
"That's not what I meant, but you're welcome. What I wanted to tell you is, #sisland_Isla Mona# is no longer safe for the likes of us. The French have taken over!",
"WHAT? What sort of force have they sent?",
"I didn't stick around to find out! But I saw a frigate.",
"Only one frigate?",
"Only? She's more than enough to take on my ship.  At least she didn't chase me - probably more concerned with securing the island.",
"Perhaps, but I reckon I could take a frigate - maybe even keep her for myself. Thanks for the message, though.",
"Good to see you, ",
"You too, ",
