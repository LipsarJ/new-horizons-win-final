"Good day, ",
"Good day, Señor.",
". I am busy and can not talk to you right now.",
"Yes, I can see you are busy. But I would like my cargo unloaded right now. If you'll do it, I'll give you 100 piastres.",
"How much is that?",
"Er... let's see... you see all the people here?",
"Yes?",
"Suppose I give you 5 piastres for each person you can see.",
"One... two... umm... lots?",
"Yes, that's right. I'll give you lots of piastres.",
"Alright. If you give me lots of piastres, then I'll unload your cargo.",
"It's the other way round. You unload my cargo, then I'll pay you.",
"No, I'm not stupid! If I unload your cargo first, you might not pay me at all!",
"I can see you are a clever man and not easily fooled. Alright, here are lots of piastres. <You give him a handful of loose change.> Now, follow me onto my ship and I'll show you the cargo.",
"Where is the cargo you want me to unload?",
"I'm afraid I have not been quite honest with you. Now please stay still so I can tie you up.",
"But how can I unload your cargo if I am tied up?",
"I don't need you to unload cargo. I need you to stay here. For a long time.",
"If you don't want me to unload cargo, why did you bring me here? Do I have to return the money?",
"No, you can keep the money. As to why you are here, I can not tell you that. Only that you need to stay here.",
"Are you going to untie me now?",
"No. I'm sorry, but you need to stay here for a while longer.",
"No, I just came down here to laugh at you.",
"Yes! I'm sorry to have kept you here so long, but now it's time for you to go home.",
"Yes, it's your lucky day. I don't want you sitting around in my hold any more and I can't be bothered to kill you.",
