"So, you are to transport me to #sIsla Muelle#?",
"Yes. By the way, I'm ",
"It's my pleasure to meet you. Now, when you arrive at #sIsla Muelle#, do not put me ashore straight away. You are to find ",
". Kill him and dispose of the body so that it will not be found. Then I will go ashore and take his place.",
"Who is this ",
"He works in the port area. You'll easily recognise him, he looks exactly the way I look now. He knows plenty, but has about the same intelligence as a pigeon.",
"How is that possible?",
"Well, for example, he'll remember anything he's told. If you were to tell him which crates to put and where, he'd know where to put them. But you'd also need to tell him not to put the big crates on top of the small ones.",
"Why do we need to kill him? Can't I just get him onto my ship and keep him there?",
"Yes, that can work as well. If you can do it without arousing suspicion, it also means you don't have to worry about hiding the body.",
"And if he's seen boarding the ship, it makes your job of leaving the ship easier. Good, then that's what we'll do.",
"Is ",
" secure?",
"Yes, he's safely tied up in my hold.",
"Good. I shall now assume his name, his manner, his position here. You may return to #sPort au Prince#. Tell the governor 'The albatross is in his nest'. That is the code phrase which will tell #spronoun2# that I am here.",
"'The albatross is in his nest'. Very well, I shall pass on your message. Goodbye, ",

", to what do I owe the honor of this visit?",
"Can I help you, ",
"?",
"Is it your first time in our town, ",
"? I haven't seen you here before.",
"Good day. Is it your job to load and unload cargo from ships?",
"Yes, ",
". For just 50 gold coins, I will load or unload your cargo.",
"Good. Here is your money. If you will please follow me, I shall show you the cargo which I would like you to unload.",
"I know you. It was you who brought me here from #sPort au Prince#, yes? Have you further orders from ",
"?",
"No, from ",
". I am ",
". Bringing you here was a necessary ruse, which is no longer necessary. And so you can either return with me to #sHavana#, or die here and now.",
"The hospitality of Spain to French agents is well known. So I shall fight you here.\nI am not well armed, so I have little chance, but a quick death here is preferable to a slow death in a torture chamber.",
"Very well. I admire your courage. Prepare to fight.",
"Where is the cargo you wish me to unload?",
"There is no cargo. You are a French spy and it is my intention to take you to #sHavana#.",
"You must be mistaken, ",
". I am ",
", I work here as a docker as I always have. If you have no cargo for me, please allow me to return to the port and resume my work.",
"You are ",
". It was I who brought you here from #sPort au Prince#. 'The albatross is in his nest', remember? Well, the albatross is about to be removed from his nest.",
"I see. But I have no intention of going anywhere near #sHavana#. ",
"Very clever! But you won't take me alive. You won't make me betray my country. Vive la France! <gulp>",
"Poison!",
