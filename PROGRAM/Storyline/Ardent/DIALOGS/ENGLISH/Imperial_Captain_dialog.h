"Good day, Capitán.",
"Good day. Are you ",
"Yes. Who are you, and why do you seek me?",
"I am ",
". ",
" sent me here. I am to be your escort.",
"Ah, good. I was told that an escort would meet me here, though to be honest, I was expecting an officer of the Spanish navy. No offence meant.",
"None taken. I said much the same thing to the ",
". He seemed to think that I was suitable for the mission, so here I am.",
"Very well. If you would care to join me in my cabin, I shall introduce you to the envoy from the Holy Roman Empire and explain our plans.",
"Lead on, then!",
"Welcome aboard the '",
"'. And may I introduce ",
".",
"Not just a lady, Capitán ",
". Share this information with nobody outside this cabin. This is the daughter of Emperor Leopold. And the correct address would be 'Your Highness'.",
"You will understand now the significance of your mission.",
"But what is the Emperor's daughter doing in the Caribbean?",
"That is not your concern. You need only know that if anything happens to her Highness, heads will roll, starting with mine. And yours.",
"Point taken. Where are we to sail?",
"It is late now. Return here tomorrow morning and I will give you your instructions.",
"Very well, I shall see you tomorrow.",
"Today, her Highness will conduct her business with the governor. We shall escort her to the residence.\nOnce she is safely there, you are free to attend to your own business here in #sIsla Muelle#. When you are ready to sail, meet me on the dock again. I should then be able to tell you our next destination.",
"Very well, let us make our way to the residence.",
"Thank you for bringing us here, Capitán ",
". Her Highness will now see the governor. We are not to be disturbed. We will meet tomorrow on the dock. By then I shall know where her Highness wishes to go next, and I shall tell you. I would like to sail early, if you please.",
"Very well. I have things to do in in #sIsla Muelle# myself. I'll see you on the dock tomorrow, then. At least there wasn't any trouble on the way here.",
"Ah, here you are, Capitán. Have you done what you wanted to do here?",
"Yes, I am ready to sail. Where are we heading?",
"Our next destination is #sSanto Domingo# on #sisland_Hispaniola#.",
"Very well. Let us set sail and hope for a smooth voyage.",
"Indeed. And when we arrive in #sSanto Domingo#, will you please join me in escorting her Highness to the town hall?",
"Certainly.",
"Where is the Electress?",
"What? She's missing! That attack must have been a diversion.",
"And we fell for it. While we were fighting the initial attackers, someone kidnapped the envoy.\nWe have no choice. We must return to #sHavana# and report this to ",
"Very well, though I suspect he will be most unhappy.",
"Thank goodness her Highness is safe!",
"Yes, that attack was just a diversion. While we were busy, someone tried to kidnap her. Fortunately, he failed.",
"We should get the envoy to the town hall quickly, lest any further attempt be made on her.",
"I agree.",
"Presumably you will wish to rest after your ordeal, your Highness?",
"Then we shall sail to #sHavana# two days from now. Please be ready to sail early in the morning, Capitán ",
"As you wish, Capitán ",
". That gives me time to restock my ship's supplies.",
"Your mission is supposed to be to escort the '",
"', but you have too many ships in your fleet. You must sell or berth some of them if you are to join me.",
"Very well, I shall visit the shipyard.",
