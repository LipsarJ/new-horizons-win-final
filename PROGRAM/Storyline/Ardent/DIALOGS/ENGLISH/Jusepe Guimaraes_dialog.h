" Do you have business with the Spanish Navy? If not, please leave, as I am very busy.",
"Sorry, ",
". I shall leave now.",
"Yes. I am ",
". I was asked by ",
" to bring you this, which I took from the naval building at #sPointe a Pitre#, #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Yes, I received a letter about you. As for what you have brought, their military value earns you 5000 piastres. The documents",
" tell me all I need to know about a forthcoming French attack on #sSantiago#.\nUnfortunately, the attack will be led by the '#swarship#'. We have nothing available which can match her. ",
"\nPlease leave now. I must consider what to do about this.",
"Very well. Goodbye and good luck, ",
"\nBut I gather that you are the sort of #sperson# who takes risks for money. If so, perhaps you can help.",
"That would depend on the risk and the money.",
"Both are high. I need you to return to #sSantiago# and evacuate the governor.",
"\nI have only two ships available at the moment. If you agree, I shall order both to sail with you in case you encounter the French fleet.",
"Then I shall leave for #sSantiago# at once. You had better be serious about the money, ",
"Sorry, but no amount of money is worth the risk of going up against the #swarship#. There's not much point in having a pile of gold if you're not alive to spend it.",
"Why are you still here?",
". I have brought this, which I took from the naval building at #sPointe a Pitre#, #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Well done, ",
"! As a reward, here are 5000 piastres. The documents which you have brought",
" to offer my assistance in the defence of #sSantiago#. He believes, as do I, that having taken #sRedmond#, the French will attack #sSantiago# next.",
"That is my assessment too. Undoubtedly the '#swarship#' will lead the attack as she did at #sRedmond#. And we have nothing available which can take her on.",
"Then there is little point in me being here.",
"Not so, Capitán. You will be well paid if you return to #sSantiago# and evacuate the governor.",
"Good day, ",
"Ah, ",
", you have arrived at an especially useful time. I have a mission for you, if you are interested.",
"Always interested, if the money is right.",
"Yes, well. One of our ships has recently entered the Caribbean, carrying an envoy from the Holy Roman Empire. You are to rendezvous with this ship and escort her here to #sHavana#.",
"A simple escort mission? Surely with the entire Spanish naval force in the Caribbean to choose from, you could find someone more suitable?",
"I could, perhaps. Now listen. This mission is of the highest importance as a lot of people, starting with the French, would be happy if the envoy went missing along the way.\nThe governor of #sSantiago# has personally recommended you. You have proven both your ability and your loyalty to Spain. You may regard this mission as a high honour.",
"I'd prefer to regard it as highly rewarding. What is the payment for this mission, if it is so important?",
"50,000 piastres, plus the prize money from anything you capture when it tries to attack the ship.",
"Very well, I accept. What is the name of the ship, and where am I to meet her?",
"Is that all? I can get more than that as prize money for the next enemy ship I find.",
"As you wish, though I imagine Governor ",
" will be disappointed by your reaction.",
"Very well, I'd hate to disappoint the governor. Tell me more about this ship you want me to escort.",
"Goodbye, ",
"Excellent! The ship is the '",
"', commanded by ",
". You will meet her in #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. ",
" will give you further instructions when you meet him. Good luck, Capitán!",
"Thank you, ",
". I shall leave for #sIsla Muelle# as soon as possible.",
"The death of ",
" while under your supposed protection will have major consequences, not merely here but across Europe. The only way to avoid a crisis with the Holy Roman Empire is to offer the Emperor the heads of those responsible. That includes yours.",
"I don't suppose I could apologise to the Emperor?",
"Your dead head will do all the apologising. The head of former governor ",
" will keep you company. Hopefully the Emperor will accept your 'apologies'. Goodbye.",
"Good day, both of you! I trust that ",
" is safely on her way to meet our governor?",
"Unfortunately no. We were attacked in #sSanto Domingo#. While we were fighting off a gang, someone sneaked up behind us and abducted her. We thought you should be informed so that a search can begin.",
"Oh, you can be sure that a search will be conducted. But neither of you will be part of it.\nYou are both under arrest. While in your cells, I suggest you pray that ",
" is found alive and unharmed. If not, you will both pay for this failure with your lives. Guards!",
"Perhaps we should not have returned here after all...",
". How goes your mission to protect ",
"The '",
"' left #sSanto Domingo# without me. But I did not see her in port. Has she left again? If so, and if you still want me to escort her, you'll need to tell me where she's gone now.",
"The '",
"' left without you, you say? I find that hard to believe.",
"Capitán ",
" did say that he wanted to leave early. Perhaps I was not early enough.",
"If that were true, he would not have left. He might have knocked on the door of your cabin or tavern room, to see if you were drunk. But he would not have left without you.",
"Then where is the '",
"'?",
"That was going to be my next question. That ship has apparently disappeared while under your protection. We may assume that the Electress was aboard at the time. You are under arrest. While in your cell, I suggest you pray that she is found alive and unharmed. If not, you will pay for this failure with your life. Guards!",
"Perhaps I should not have returned here after all...",
"There has been a development in your case, ",
"Have you found ",
"No, we still search for her. But there is now evidence that you did not merely fail to protect the '",
"', you were personally responsible for stealing her.",
"No, we still search for her. But there is now evidence that you did not merely fail to protect the Electress, you were personally responsible for her kidnap.",
"There must be some mistake!",
"Yes, and it was yours. And possibly also the mistake of ",
". Of your guilt there is no doubt - once a pirate, always a pirate, it seems. All that remains now is to determine whether Don ",
" was another victim of your deception or was actively involved in your conspiracy.\nYou will be questioned later. Further investigation will determine whether Don ",
" will lose his head or merely his job. Goodbye, ",
"Wait! What is this evidence against me? Come back!",
"Ah, Capitán ",
", we finally have you back. Though I am surprised that you walked straight into #sHavana# to be caught so easily.",
"I am here to clear my name, ",
". As you can see, I have brought ",
" with me.",
"Do you really believe that this will excuse you from kidnapping her in the first place?",
"I did not kidnap her. You have probably heard from people who heard the kidnappers claiming to work for me. They made sure to say that, loudly and repeatedly, precisely so that you would believe that it was I who took the Electress. Their intention was for me to take the blame.",
"And yet we have here a ransom demand, signed by you.",
"You may have a ransom demand with my name on it, but I did not write it.",
"Alright, suppose I were to believe you. You have probably made many enemies during your career. Do you wish to name one of them as being behind the kidnap?",
"No, ",
". You will recall that you told me that, because of his association with me, ",
" was also under suspicion. That, in fact, was the reason for the kidnap. And the man behind it is ",
".",
"The governor of #sSantiago#?",
"The replacement governor. He devised the whole plot precisely to take over the post of governor as a step towards a position at the Spanish royal court. Had I not rescued the Electress, his plan was to collect her, present her here, and claim to have rescued her himself.",
"You realise that this is a serious accusation? Why should I believe you? You seem to be making exactly the claim that you say Don ",
" would have made.",
"It would make no sense for me to have done it. I already had status with Spain; that is why you asked me to escort the Electress. I should throw that all away, then return here just to try to get back what I already had? Nonsense!",
"Your Highness makes a good case for Capitán ",
". So, what would you have me do?",
"Very well, that seems fair. ",
"I shall send a squad of soldiers to arrest ",
", and ",
" will be restored to office. Meanwhile, ",
", your status is hereby restored. Your officers ",
"and ship",
"and ships",
" will be released.",
".",
", I have one favour to ask. You will understand that I have a personal interest in ",
". May I lead the soldiers who are to arrest him?",
"Yes, certainly. He is more likely to resist arrest if you are there, which will avoid any... complications... from bringing him to trial.",
"Thank you, ",
". I shall soon go to #sSantiago# to bring him to justice, whether that is trial by court or trial by combat.",
"You will not need to arrest ",
". I have already paid him a visit. All that is necessary is to arrange a funeral.",
"Out of the question! That ship will be needed to transport her Highness back to Europe.",
"That is most kind, your Highness.",
"Since you are so insistent, your Highness, then I agree to your request. It should be possible to find another ship to take you home.",
"Next, ",
", we will discuss your payment. You were originally to be paid 50,000 piastres for escorting ",
". In this you failed, as she was kidnapped while under your protection. However, since you were also responsible for her rescue, and taking into account her own report of your conduct, I am prepared to pay you half that amount.",
"Fair enough, I suppose.",
"No! I demand the full payment!",
"A wise choice, ",
".",
"I'm just relieved to have my good name back, ",
". And my officers.",
"You wish to stick to the original contract? Very well. As I said, ",
" was kidnapped while under your protection. You failed the mission. Therefore you will not be paid at all. Let that be a lesson in case you wish to test my patience again.",
"<Thinks: I'd better not complain any more in case he decides not to give my my ships back either.>",
"Now there is the matter of ships. Firstly, after your arrest, you escaped from #sisland_Cuba# on a ship owned by ",
".",
"So that's where the ship came from!",
" gave me that ship himself!",
"Hmm... Well, you'll be pleased to know that ",
" does not intend to press any charges. However, he would like his ship back.\n",
"As you have such a ship in your fleet, it would be simplest to exchange it for your original ship, the '",
"'.",
"Yes, that is fine with me. I can re-arrange my fleet later if I want.",
"As you have no such ship, it would be simplest for you to buy him a replacement. I shall order the shipyard to provide a similar vessel if you give me 18500 piastres to cover the cost.",
"Very well, and please give ",
" my thanks for the loan of his ship.",
"Unfortunately I do not have that much.",
"Probably the result of many bad decisions on your part, such as refusing my offer of partial payment! If you are that unsuccessful a captain, your own crew will probably punish you sufficiently. So I shall pay for the replacement ship myself.",
"Thank you, ",
". Also, please give ",
"You yourself were in command of that vessel, so your original flagship, the '#sflagship#' will be assigned to you.",
" was in command of that vessel and will be assigned command of your original flagship, the '#sflagship#'.",
"Your original flagship, the '#sflagship#', has been transferred to the command of ",
", one of your officers.",
", who was placed in command of that ship while she was interned and who is now to be transferred to your command.",
" However, there is no space in your fleet for the '#sflagship#' to be transferred to you now. You will need to sell, berth or scrap one of your ships first.",
"You yourself were in command of the '#sgalleon#', so your original flagship, the '#sflagship#' will be assigned to you.",
" was in command of the '#sgalleon#' and will be assigned command of your original flagship, the '#sflagship#'.",
"As you have chosen to give up the '#sgalleon#', your original flagship, the '#sflagship#', will be transferred back to your personal command.",
"What about the rest of the ships which were taken from me when I was arrested?",
"According to the records, you had ",
" ships before your arrest. ",
" ships before your arrest, including the '#sflagship#' which has yet to be reassigned to you.",
" You currently have ",
" ship.",
" ships.",
"only the '#sflagship#', which will be assigned back to you.",
"only the '#sflagship#', which has yet to be reassigned to you.",
" There should be no problem in returning your original fleet to you.",
"Your current fleet is too large to allow your original ships to be returned. You should sell or berth some of your current ships so that your original ships can be returned.",
"You will need to sell or berth your entire current fleet if your original ships are to be returned.",
"Thank you, ",
". Goodbye, for now.",
"Very well, ",
". I shall visit the shipyard now.",
"I am ready to reclaim my fleet now, ",
".",
"You do not even have space in your current fleet to receive your original flagship!",
"Your original flagship has already been returned to you, ",
".",
"Yes, it is now possible to return your other ships to you.",
", I have been to arrest ",
". He attempted to resist arrest and I had to kill him.",
"Officially, it would have been better if you had been able to bring him to trial. Unofficially, it means I do not need to arrange transport for him to Spain, nor will there be any embarrassment caused by such a trial.",
" has already been released and is on his way to #sSantiago# as we speak. Now, is there anything else?",
"No, ",
", that is all I wanted to report.",
"I was wondering if you have another mission for me ",
".",
"Perhaps. We have reason to believe that the French have planted a spy in #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#, but we have no idea as to the identity or location of this spy. As you have associates in unusual places for a servant of the Spanish navy, perhaps you would have more success in finding out about this spy?",
"Umm... yes, I think I may be able to help with that.",
"Excellent, ",
". There will be a small reward if you can bring useful information about the spy and a large reward if you can locate and neutralise the spy yourself.",
"The small reward probably isn't worth my time, so I'll try for the large one.",
"You might need this. It tells whoever reads it that you are acting under my authority. The governor of #sIsla Muelle# will probably be more co-operative if you show the document to him.",
"Thank you, ",
". I shall leave now to begin my investigation.",
"Ah, ",
", you have returned. Does this mean you have anything to report about the spy in #sIsla Muelle#?",
"No, ",
". I am still working on that.",
"Yes, ",
". The spy's name was ",
". He was posing as a dock worker named ",
". I found the real ",
" and brought him back to #sIsla Muelle#. The soldiers there tried to arrest ",
" but he swallowed poison before he could be taken. He's dead.",
". I pretended to believe that the spy really was the docker, invited him aboard my ship on the pretext of unloading cargo, then told him I knew who he was. He tried to fight me, so I had to kill him.",
"Hmm... it would have been better if this ",
" could have been brought in alive to tell us more about French spy operations. However, you have done well to eliminate him. Here is your reward.",
"Thank you, ",
". And now I must leave. Goodbye.",
"Your original flagship, the '#sflagship#', has been given back to you.",
