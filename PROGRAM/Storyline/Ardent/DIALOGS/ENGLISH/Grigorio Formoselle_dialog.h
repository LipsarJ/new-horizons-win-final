"Good day, ",
"Good day to you, too.",

"Very well, give it to me. I shall take it to ",
" myself.",
"No, I was told to deliver it to ",
"And now you have been told to give it to me. We do not allow just anyone access to the private areas of the residence.",
"Very well, but I shall tell ",
" that you prevented me from delivering the letter.",
"Please do, and pass on my regards. ",
" will certainly be pleased that I prevented such a person as yourself from visiting ",
". Goodbye.",
"Goodbye.",
"I have once again been asked to deliver a letter to ",
", and was also asked to show you this ring.",
"Ah, that must have been given to you by ",
" in person. Very well, as you are now trusted, you may proceed. I shall escort you to the room of ",
"Thank you.",
"What are you doing in here? Nobody should be on the premises at this time of night!",
"You're going to take me to the chamber of ",
", at gunpoint if necessary.",
"And if I refuse?",
"I'll kill you, of course. Then I'll find my own way there and kill anyone else who gets in my way.",
"What do you intend to do when you get there?",
"That's between me and ",
". Suffice to say that you'll be saving several lives, yours and ",
"'s among them, if you co-operate.",
"Very well, you leave me no choice. This way.",
"Excellent choice.",
"They've killed the governor! That's the assassin there!",
"Blast! I should have killed you, too!",
"So, you're here.",
"Yes, I didn't want to deprive you of ",
"'s company, or for that matter deprive the money of my company, any longer.",
"Very droll. I should warn you that the fort has its guns trained on your ship and a high power spyglass trained on me. If your ship tries to sail without me first giving a very specific hand signal, it will be attacked.",
"And if you try anything funny, you'll be attacked. Alright, that's the formalities out of the way. Shall we trade?",
"You first, if you please. Release ",
"Very well, someone has to make the first sign of good faith. ",
", step forward please. You're free to go.",
", I am pleased to see you. Have these pirates mistreated you in any way?",
"Alright, as you have indeed not harmed ",
", you may leave in peace. <Makes complicated gestures at the fort.>",
"Aren't you forgetting something? The gold?",
"Ah, yes. Here you are. ",
" gold as agreed. And a warning from the governor. Though he would like you to spend the rest of your life hanging around in town somewhere, he advises that you never again set foot in #sSantiago#.",
"If we're back to trading threats then note that I've faced that fort before, and I've been in and out of your residence. So if so much as one cannon fires, I'll be back for revenge. But if your word is good then it is indeed time to move on - there's no point in robbing someone who is fully alert and short of money because he's just been fleeced. Give my regards to the governor, and farewell!",
"May I see that ring, please? Ah... that is the signet ring of #svillain# - #spronoun# courier carried such a ring to show that he was trusted to gain access to #sromance#.",
"Meaning anyone who carries such a ring is employed by #svillain#.",
"Move quickly! We do not have much time. I gave the guards some brandy laced with something from our medicine cabinet but they won't be unconscious for long.",
"Why should I trust you? First I'm given the honour of escorting an Imperial envoy, who mysteriously disappears, and then I end up in here.",
"You would prefer to wait here until ",
" returns with your death warrant? I'll explain once we are safe but we have to leave now!",
"Very well. Since you put it that way, I don't have much choice.",
"And don't forget to collect your equipment. The commandant has it and is in no position to refuse - for now.",
"Alright, I'll collect my stuff on the way out. Let's go!",
"Your ship was impounded after your arrest. You won't get near it now.",
"Your ships were impounded after your arrest. You won't get near them now.",
" But I have a small ship moored at Punta de Maisi. You can escape on that.",
"Any ship is better than being stuck here. Let's get to the beach!",
"Alright, I think we're safe for now. And you want to know what is going on.",
"Damn right I do! And it had better be good.",
" knows that ",
" recommended you for the escort mission. The almirante believes you betrayed him, and that my master may be in league with you. So my master has also been arrested.\nHis only hope now is if you can find out who really kidnapped ",
". That is also your only hope.\nI must return to the residence before I am missed and suspicion falls on me too. Good luck, Capitán ",
"Thanks! You've done the right thing, ",
". I'll find out who is really responsible. If possible, I'll bring them in myself. Goodbye!",
"Did you remember to collect your equipment?",
"Yes, the commandant must have dropped it all when he passed out.",
"No! Thanks for reminding me.",
"I didn't have anything important anyway.",
"Very well. But you can't go back to the port.",
"Why not?",
