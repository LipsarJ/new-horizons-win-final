"Hello. Who are you?",
"I'm ",
". And I'm in need of your help.",
"Sorry, I'm mistaken.",
"So, you are in need of my help again?",
"That's the pirate life...",
"Thank goodness, no. Such help is too expensive.",
"So you are in trouble with the pirates?",
"No, with Spain. Someone has kidnapped an envoy from the Holy Roman Empire. It wasn't me and apparently it wasn't any other pirate either.",
"Then I'm not sure what I can do. I have no influence in Spain.",
"No, but you do work for France. Officially, at least. And as France is at war with the Empire, they're the next most likely suspect after the pirates. So, do you know if anyone French is responsible?",
"If I did, the information would cost you. So I regret to say that I do not.\nAs you say, officially I work for France. But being stuck here on a pirate island on the back end of #sisland_Hispaniola#, I am not given to know the workings of the French court.\nDo you know from where the envoy was taken?",
"Yes, from #sSanto Domingo#. While I was supposed to be protecting her, too, which is why I'm being blamed.",
"I see. If France was indeed involved in anything in #sSanto Domingo#, then ",
" will probably know about it. She's the governor of #sPort au Prince#.",
"Then I should ask her?",
"Yes, but you'll need to be more discreet than you were here. If you simply go barging in asking questions as you did here, you'll probably be arrested on the spot.",
" Especially as France does not like you very much.",
"Yes, I see your point. I shall need to make up a cover story. And then I shall visit #sPort au Prince#.",
" Thanks for your help!",
"You might also want a disguise. The local tailor should have something unsuitable for a pirate but suitable for someone wanting to visit a governor.",
"Good idea. I'll go and see the tailor right away.",
