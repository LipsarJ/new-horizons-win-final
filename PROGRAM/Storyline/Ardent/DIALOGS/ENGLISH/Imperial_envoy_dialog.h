"Good day, Kapitän.",
"Good day, my lady.",
"Good day, your Highness.",
"I am pleased to meet you, Kapitän.",
"I am ",
". The pleasure is mine, my lady. Capitán ",
", I was not told that the envoy was a lady.",
"My apologies, your Highness. I hope I have not offended you.",
"No, I am not offended so easily.\nIndeed, should you need to speak to me ashore, please continue to call me 'lady'. We do not want to tell people who I am.",
"Very wise, my - that is, your Highness.",
"Thank you for defending me, Kapitän ",
". And thank you also, Kapitän ",
"You are welcome, your Highness. I am just relieved that you are safe.",
"I shall indeed rest until tomorrow. Then I shall speak with his Excellency ",
"Where am I? Ah, Kapitän ",
", so it was you who was responsible for my abduction!",
"Not so, your Highness. I am here to take you to #sHavana#.",
"The abductors said that they worked for you.",
"Yes, that's what they want you, and everyone else, to believe. They've set me up.",
"Then why is this man with you?",
"He was threatening to kill you, and well placed to do so. Agreeing to take him to the port of his choice was the only way to secure your release.",
"He was threatening to kill you, and well placed to do so. He did not work for me before but he does now. Hiring him was the only way to secure your release.",
"That is not acceptable! He must face justice for what he did to me.",
"Sorry, but I gave him my word, and that is the only reason why you are not still a prisoner, or dead. Besides, he's just the hired help. The true villain is the man who hired him, ",
". And I'm going after him next. He certainly will face justice, either on a gallows or on my sword.",
"Why should I believe you, Kapitän ",
"Perhaps you shouldn't. You will only know the truth when you find out what happens when you are aboard my ship.",
"So, your Highness, would you care to join me in a little walk back to the beach?",
" Which reminds me - where is ",
"Your men - excuse me, the kidnappers - killed him when they boarded the '",
"'.",
"I am sorry to hear that. He was a good man and I have no doubt that he fought to the last.",
"Thank you for that.",
"Now, your Highness, would you care to join me in a little walk back to the beach?",
"Since you ask so politely, and since I can not remain here alone, yes, I shall walk with you to the ship.",
"Thank you, your Highness. This way, if you please.",
"Where am I, Kapitän ",
"You were being kept in a cave, your Highness. I threw a bottle of ether to knock out the kidnappers. Of course, it knocked you out as well. But it meant I did not risk you being killed if I had to fight them. We're now outside the cave.",
"That was sensible. I forgive you for stunning me with your bottle.",
"Thanks. Let us return to my ship.",
"The kidnappers killed him when they boarded the '",
"So, Kapitän ",
", you really are in league with those who abducted me!",
"Now that you have killed your men, Kapitän ",
", what do you intend to do to me?",
"Those were not my men, your Highness. They claimed to work for me in order to discredit me, and also to discredit ",
". Their employer knows of my association with the governor and wants to take his position. What I do not yet know is who that employer is.",
"You still have not answered my question, Kapitän. What do you intend to do to me?",
"I shall take you to #sHavana#, of course. Only by taking you to the admiral or the governor can I clear my name, and also the name of ",
".",
"Though I am still unsure about you, I shall share this information with you. The kidnappers may have made a mistake. I once overheard one of them say 'I wonder when ",
" will pay us'. Perhaps that is the name of the man behind this.",
"It could well be. I may decide to go to #sSantiago# first, to confront this ",
". If so, I hope you will forgive the delay in your journey to #sHavana#. But now, would you please follow me to my ship, your Highness?",
"If I understand correctly, Kapitän ",
", you wish me to believe that this gang does not work for you and has surrendered to you?",
"Exactly so, your Highness. Hiring them now avoided a fight in which you might have been killed. Before that, they only claimed to work for me in order to discredit me, and also to discredit ",
".",
"Soldier, I AM ",
"! This #sperson# has not kidnapped me, but has rescued me from the kidnappers. Now, you will stand aside and let us pass. Or I shall speak to your commanding officer. If you are lucky you will lose your job. If you are unlucky you will lose your head. Do I make myself clear?",
"You will address me as 'your Highness'. And then you will allow us to pass.",
"Now, I believe you have an appointment with ",
", though he does not know it yet.",
"Yes. Let's go to the town hall.",
"Well? Shall we go in?",
"Your Highness, with respect, I suggest you remain out here. When ",
" realises that the game is up, he may do something violent. In fact, I hope he does. But I don't want him doing it to you. You would be safer to wait out here. If you want, I can show you the body when it is safe.",
"That won't be necessary. I need only your word that justice has been done, I don't need to see more blood. Not even his.",
"Very well. Then if I am not back out here in, say, ten minutes, get back to my ship and tell the crew to take you to #sHavana#. But I expect to be able to give you good news sooner than that.",
"Perhaps, ",
", you will also take into account that I believe #spronoun2#. I have had time to think this over during my journey to #sHavana#. The actions of Kapitän ",
" before my abduction, and #spronoun3# behaviour after #spronoun# arrived at the cave where I was being held, are consistent with #spronoun3# claim. In addition, though the kidnappers also claimed to me that they worked for Kapitän ",
", I never once saw #spronoun2# until #spronoun# came to my rescue. But there was one time when the kidnappers believed me to be asleep and I overheard them mention the name of ",
". They believed that it was he who would pay them.",
"Clearly Kapitän ",
" should be restored to the status which #spronoun# once held with Spain. All #spronoun3# officers should be released. Any ship belonging to Kapitän ",
" which was impounded should be returned.",
" And, of course, ",
" must be brought to justice.",
"I have one further wish. ",
" should retain command of the '",
"', if #spronoun# wishes.",
"Thank you, your Highness! I had not expected such a reward.",
"With respect, your Highness, I shall decline that generous offer. Though the '",
"' is a fine ship, I do not need her.",
", I shall of course report to my father all that has happened, including your part in it. That part can be told in different ways. For example, I could say that you wisely appointed ",
" as my escort. Then, when I was kidnapped, you cunningly found exactly the right way to motivate #spronoun2# to find out who was responsible.",
"Or I could say that after I was kidnapped, you were easily fooled by the kidnappers and arrested ",
", then completely failed to help me with your own ships while preventing ",
" from coming to my aid. And that it was despite your bungling that #spronoun# escaped, found me, and found the true kidnappers. Which report would you prefer?",
"Then, ",
", it remains only for me to thank you again for your services. I wish you all the best in your further voyages.",
"It has been both my honour and my pleasure to serve you, your Highness. And in turn I thank you for supporting me when I needed it. May your journey home be pleasant.",
"Well, Kapitän? Has justice been done?",
"Yes, your Highness. ",
", the man behind your kidnap, who used you as his pawn and who caused me so much trouble, is dead.",
"Very well. Now, please take me to #sHavana#.",
"Certainly, your Highness. Hopefully when I bring you there safely, I can finally clear my name.",
