"Who are you?",
"What? I didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition!",
"NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our main weapon is surprise. Surprise and speed - our *two* main weapons are surprise and speed. And as I'm out of soft cushions and short on time, I repeat - who are you?",
"I am Charles Ardent.",
"I am Helen Ardent.",
"What do you want?",
"I want adventure, excitement and romance.",
"Never mind all that nonsense. I'm a black-hearted sea-robber and am only interested in gold, gold and more gold!",
"Who do you serve and who do you trust?",
"What part of 'PIRATES of the Caribbean' don't you understand?",
"I serve only myself and trust only my sword. I won't start any fights but I will finish them.",
"Thank you for your assistance. We may now commence.",
"Commence what? Hey, come back...",
"What is this? How can you have such power over me? You must be cheating. Very well, what is your bidding?",
"Huh? I didn't expect you to return. Let me get on with the game!",
"Can we skip right to the attack on Isla Mona?",
"As you wish. You will appear in #sSantiago#. Go to any of #sRedmond#, #sSanto Domingo#, #sIsla Muelle# or any pirate base. Someone will contact you.",
"Excellent. NOW we may commence.",
"You are accused of heresy on three counts. Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed and heresy by action - four counts. Do you confess?",
"No!",
"Alright, I did it.",
"Look, it's not going to work unless you co-operate. You have to refuse to confess, then we can torture you.",
"Oh, alright. No, I do not confess!",
"Hah! Then we shall make you confess! Cardinal Fang - fetch the Comfy Chair!",
"Oh, no! Not the Comfy Chair!",
"The Comfy Chair? Sorry, sir. It hasn't been delivered yet.",
"A true Inquisitor needs no such trinkets.",
"Who are you? There are only supposed to be two of us.",
"There can be only one. Begone!",
"I have been following your adventures with interest, ",
"Who are you?",
"Do you not remember? At the beginning? I asked you some questions. Since then, I have been watching. Adjusting.",
"Adjusting what?",
"Whatever needed to be adjusted in accordance with your answers to those questions. But now that is at an end. You are on your own. And I must leave. Someone, somewhere, has just started the story which you have just finished.",
"Hey, come back! I haven't finished with you yet!",
"Just as I no longer have power over you, you no longer have that power over me.",
"Then good luck to whoever is playing at being me. Maybe I'll meet them some day, in a forum or some such.",
"You here for the Inquisition Experience? Talk to #sotherguy# over there. I'm just the assistant.",
"Thanks, I'll do that.",
