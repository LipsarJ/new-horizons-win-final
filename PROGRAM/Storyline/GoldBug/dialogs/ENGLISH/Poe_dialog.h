"William dear friend, sorry for this intrusion. The weather's really chilly so I lighted a fire, hope you don't mind?",
"Of course not, be welcome old friend. We'll have dinner soon.",
"Guess you have been out hunting all day?",
"Indeed we have. Here's Jupiter now...",
"Yes, what can I do for you?",
"Oh, nothing for the moment.",
"What have you got there, some new shells?",
"Yes, and I think one of them is an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus! Here, please take a look.",
"They're so beautiful, ... but you found something more. I can see that on your face William.",
"Indeed I did. I have hunted down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a scarabæus which I believe to be totally new, but in respect to which I wish to have your opinion on the morrow.",
"And why not to-night?",	//10
"Ah, if I had only known you were here! But it's so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others? As I was coming home I met Lieutenant G——, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!",
"What? — sunrise?",
"Nonsense! no! — the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color — about the size of a large hickory-nut — with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The antennæ are ...",
"Guess we'll be without dinner now. But tell me, is the bug really so fantastic?",
"Oh my friend is little impulsive... And yes, the color is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit — but of this you cannot judge till to-morrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.",
"What are you looking for my friend?",
"I know there's ink and a pen here somewhere. Perhaps some paper too.",
"May I see...?",
"Sure!",
"It's really getting hot in here. Could you please lower the fire somehow.",	//20
"I'll see what I can do...",
"The weather's really chilly so how about a little more fire?",
"The weather's really chilly so how about another fire?",
"Well! This is a strange scarabæus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it before — unless it was a skull, or a death's-head — which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation.",
"A death's-head! Oh — yes — well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth — and then the shape of the whole is oval.",
"Perhaps so, but Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance.",
"Well, I don't know, I draw tolerably — should do it at least — have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.",
"But, my dear fellow, you are joking then, this is a very passable skull — indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology — and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it. Why we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint. I presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis, or something of that kind — there are many similar titles in the Natural Histories. But where are the antennæ you spoke of?",
"The antennæ! I am sure you must see the antennæ. I made them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient.",
"Well, well, perhaps you have — still I don't see them.",			//30
"---",
"Good night my friend, I see you are getting more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse you.",
"Well I... the parchment... hmm. Jupiter escorts you on your way back home. Farewell.",
"Ahh William, welcome! Please sit down. And come in Jupiter, come in.",
"Good to see you Edgar.",
"Now tell me my old friend, what brings you here.",
"Well, it's a long and strange story. You remember the parchment I showed you...",
"This is existing. You've found the three letters T H E so far?",
"Yes, but after that it's getting difficult...",
"If you go to the second THE from the end, you find this sequence  'THET EETH'.",	//40
"Yes..?",
"Presume that the last 'TH' is the commencement of a new word and that we discard the first 'THE', since no word can be formed of which this 'TH' can be a part. We are thus narrowed into the word 'T EE'.",
"That word must be 'TREE' then. So '(' is the letter R!",
"Indeed. Now looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we have thus this arrangement: 'THE TREE THR...H THE'.",
"Yes I see this place...",
"Here a word makes itself evident at once. Maybe you should take a brake (save) and consult that squared paper you've got there.",
"Okay but but I, how...",
"I have a suggestion old friend. Why don't you go visit Mr Dupin, he's an old friend of mine and a very intelligent investigator.",
"You mean the famous Detective? Hmm, where does he live?",
"It's very easy to find William, he's office is near the Town Gates to the Port.",		//50
"I'll find that. Thank you Edgar and goodbye. And, ehh, my copy of the cipher if you don't mind...",
"Let me ask you, did you manage to figure out which letter the symbol  'X'  corresponds to?",
"No, I don't have the slightest idea.",
"Maybe you should try again. Don't forget to check the Questbook.",
"Yes it's  'A'",	//55
"Yes it's  'B'",	
"Yes it's  'C'",
"Yes it's  'D'",
"Yes it's  'F'",
"Yes it's  'G'",	//60
"Yes it's  'I'",
"Yes it's  'J'",
"Yes it's  'K'",	
"Yes it's  'L'",	
"Yes it's  'M'",	//65
"Yes it's  'N'",
"Yes it's  'O'",
"Yes it's  'P'",
"Yes it's  'Q'",
"Yes it's  'S'",	//70
"Yes it's  'U'",
"Yes it's  'V'",
"Yes it's  'W'",
"Yes it's  'X'",
"Yes it's  'Y'",	//75
"Yes it's  'Z'",
"Very good. Maybe you have an idea about the  '?'  too.",
"You're really doing fine. And  '3'  which letter should that be?",
"Yes I believe so too. The word must be  'THROUGH'  , this discovery gives us three new letters. Looking, now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this  'EGREE'  ...",
" 'EGREE'  ?",	//80
"Absolutely! And two more letters thanks to Jupiter. However, I'm really sorry dear William, but I have to leave you this very moment for business.",
"Welcome back dear friend! What can I do for you?",
"Thank you Edgar, you see I have solved the crypto but it doesn't make much sense...",
"Can I hear what you have got so far?",
"Here it is: 'A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death's-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.'",
"Hmm...",	//86
"No, the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever. How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about 'devil's seats,' 'death's heads,' and 'bishop's hotels?'",
"I confess that the matter still wears a serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor is to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist.",
"You mean, to punctuate it?",
"Please, come in and sit down, both of you.",	//90
"Thank you.",
"Something of that kind. Do you have a clean paper left?",
"Sure, just a second...",
"I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution. Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object, would be nearly certain to overdo the matter. When, in the course of his composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this place, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding.",
"Acting upon this hint, I made the division thus:",
"Now if you please would excuse me...",
"Of course, and thank you my friend. I have to think this over very carefully.",
"Aha, welcome my friends.",
"Edgar, I'm sorry for this intrusion.",
"Not at all my friend. What can I do for you today?",		//100
"Well, we're looking for some navigation instruments.",
"The only thing I've got is an old and heavy Compass...",
"Can we borrow it for a while?",
"Of course, just a second...",
"That's very kind of you Edgar.",
"Here's the Compass, complete with a bag to carry it in.",
"Thank you Edgar.",
"I guess you're exploring the clues from that cipher...",
"Indeed we are, why don't you join us?",
"It sounds exiting but today I have a very important appointment.",	//110
"Another day then Edgar.",
"And..?",
"Oh, sorry for this intrusion Edgar. We need your help though...",
"Hmm, just give me a minute to get dressed. Maybe you can wait upstairs in my room...",
"Of course. Let's go Jupiter.",
"Let me guess: you have found out the clues in that Cipher and need help to carry the Pirate Treasure.",
"!!! How could you guess all this? It's even more than I know. Pirates you say? Please tell us more.",
"The Parchment you showed me had a figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid.",
"You will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goat — pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats: they appertain to the farming interest.",
"But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.",		//120
"Well, a kid then — pretty much the same thing.",
"Pretty much, but not altogether. You may have heard of one Captain Kidd?",
"Of course, go on please.",
"I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature, because its position upon the vellum suggested this idea. The death's-head at the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal.",
"Yes, I have heard a lot of stories about Captain Kidd's Treasure. But to believe they are true..?",
"You will observe that the stories told are all about moneyseekers, not about money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped. I took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them and felt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved a lost record of the place of deposit.",
"You're right, we have found some strange things in a place called Bishop's Hostel. Thing's that very well could be a Pirate's work.",
"But you have not got the Treasure yet?",				//128
"No, we need more Tools than one Spade for that. There is also a problem with a group of very hostile Maroons. So we need weapons as well. And besides that we want you to join us in this Treasure hunt.",
"I'll follow you - this is so exciting. About weapons, I have a fine Pistol at the Blacksmith for repairs. However I can't afford to pay for it...",
"Here take your compass, maybe you can trade it to the Blacksmith.",
"Thank you William. I have an idea of how to we can find some Tools without paying for them...",
"Very good. I'll visit the Fort for a weapon of any sort. We have some old empty sacks at home Jup. Could you get them please.",
"William, let's meet outside the towngates when we have collected all things.",
"Outside the town it will be.",
"I found these Nails in the Church - maybe you can use them?",
"Yeah, why not Jupiter?",
"So this is the Tree with the Deaths-head?",	//138
"Indeed it is. Now Jupiter, if you please would do us the favour and climb the Tree again?",
"What's he doing up there? It's so silent.",
"???",
"As I remembered it there was something about a beeline from the tree through the 'shot'. But how long should it be?",
"I have to consult my papers.",
"So, how long should the line be?",		//144
"Ehrmm, I have to check again...",
"Fifty feet.",
"Okay. Now Jupiter if you please would take the end of this Measuring Tape and place yourself close to the Tree.",
"Aha.",
"I'll stretch out the Measuring Tape fifty feet beyond the peg then.",
"Very good Edgar. We're getting close now!",
"Come! we must go back, the game's not up yet.",
"That will do — we must try it again.",
"Jup has to climb the Tulip-Tree again then.",
"No no, we'll just place another peg close to the first one.",
"Right, please go on Edgar.",
"What's this? X marks the spot?",
"Hmm, why not. Lets's move these poor bastards - there's something under the skeletons!",
"William, let me try with the Pickaxe.",
"Yes, good idea!",
"Yes that's strange, where are the maroons? Maybe they lost our track?",
"Who knows. We have to be very careful.",
"Ha, what a victory!",
"What is it Jupiter?",
"Think I'll sit up for a while and make some notes -",
"- I've got an idea from our adventure!",
"William dear friend, don't worry - be happy. The Treasure is safe, Jupiter has only moved it to the attic.",	//166
"Very good! And you are still awake Edgar?",									//167
"Yes I got a little carried away with my writing. When you have taken a closer look of the Treasure, I'll be very pleased if you want to listen to my new short story.",	//168
"Well of course Edgar, I'll be happy to.",									//169
"Ohh, and what about all the other stuff we looted from the maroons?",
"Jupiter took care of everything. The Food is in the Grot, Weapons of course in the Weaponslocker and Tools in the Chests right behind you.",
"And the more valuable things?",
"He brought them together with the Treasure to the attic.",							//173
