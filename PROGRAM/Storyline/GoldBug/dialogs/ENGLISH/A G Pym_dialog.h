"I'm hungry - I need protein.",
"(Better stay out of the way)",
"What do you want?",
"Mr Pym, I'm looking for navigation tools. I have this fine clock...",
"Well... what about doing me a favour instead?",
"Sure, what do you have in mind Mr Pym?",
"The thing is you see, that the stupid Tailor has left for vacation and locked me out.",
"And you want me to brake in?",
"No, the Tailor's door is impossible, but there's another way into my rooms.",
"Yes?",
"When I was younger I climbed over the roofs sometimes, just for fun.",
"What item do you trade for a dangerous climb like that, Mr Pym?",
"I have a Sextant if you're interested.",
"Alright, show me where I start the climbing.",
"There used to be a ladder at the building opposite to that Detective's office.",
"Mister Dupin, that's easy to find. I'm already on my way...",
"Finally, I'm starving - I could eat a horse.",
"(Hope he'll stick to that) What about our deal? Hey mister...",
"The sextant is in the Tower Room.",
"Okay. (Where is that?)",
"Not so fast Mister, you'll need my spare Key to the Tailor's.",
"And where do you keep that Key?",
"It's in my bedroom.",
"Okay, see you later then.",
