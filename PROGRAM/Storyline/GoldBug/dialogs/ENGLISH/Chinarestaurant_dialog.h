"What is it now - I'm a very busy man.",
"Oh, nothing for the moment.",
"Ahh gentlemen, we have not opened yet.",
"We're not here to eat. You sell Fireworks right?",
"Usually I do but everything has been delayed because of the Malaria.",
"Hmm, not even Gunpowder?",
"No, all is finished. But I have an idea...",
"Okay, let's hear.",
"You're right Mister. My staff is still ill and I'm waiting guests any moment. 
This is what I offer: if you help me in the Restaurant and mix the Gunpowder yourselves I let you keep all the powder you need.",
"I see, but Jupiter's right - the Gunpowder Mill IS a dangerous place!",
"Not if you follow the formula carefully. I have written a recipe, so no problems.",	//10
"What do you say Jupiter?",
"Go to the Gunpowder Mill and get familiar with the equipment.",
"See you later then, Jupiter.",
"Where is that Mill?",
"At the gate to Charleston. And yes, the door gets stuck sometimes - just push hard.",
"You have succeded with the Gunpowder I see - very good. Here, hand over those barrels.",
"Sure.",
"The thing is I need a little more Gunpowder than that. Here, take this Key and keep up the good work.",
"Very well... (sigh)",
"I see on your face you have managed to produce more Gunpowder. Very Good.",		//20
"Yes, here you are. Now to the Gunpowder and the Fireworks you promised us?",
"Sure, here take some Gunpowder, and I'll provide your mate with some as well. Fireworks though is another thing you know...",
"No I don't so let's hear it.",
"You need another type of Gunpowder for Fireworks - a slow burning one.",
"Mhm, and you want me to produce that too.",			//25
"I think it's a good idea. Here's the Recipe, place it in the Red Folder.",
"But I've ran out of raw materials.",
"No problem, I have unlocked all the three workshops.",
"Uh uh, this will not be easy I guess...",
"Yes, but you have to find the red Folder first.",		//30
"Okay, I go back inside and search for it then.",
"Here's the Recipe, place it in the Red Folder.",
"Look, everything is very complicated in the workshops and I need more Tools to continue!",
"Maybe you do - why don't you help me search the Restaurant for things the guests may have left behind?",				//35
"You did it! Give me those Barrels.",				//35
"Okay, and now to the question of Fireworks...",
"Follow me to my Laboratory and I'll put something together in a minute.",
"Lead the way out.",
"Not if you remember to add some Water to the Big Barrel before grinding the Gunpowder.",
"Where do I get the Water?",					//40
"There's a Wheel on the wall.",
"Okay, I'll keep that in mind.",
"So there you are, Mister Legrand. Please sit down if you want while I put something together for you.",
"Ahh, very well.",
"... but first I must get the Special Gunpowder -",
"- and yes I got a Barrel here on that chest.",
".... so I have to make new cylinders for the Rockets -",
"- of that Paper over there.",
"... if it takes a little time -",
"- but you will not be disappointed, Mister Legrand.",
"... Mister Legrand, but I have made a fine little collection of Fireworks for you. They are numbered from one to sixteen. Fire them in that order for the best effect!",
"Finally! Ehrmm - I mean thanks a lot!",
"... so you can leave all those other items here please.",
"Very well, goodbye.",
