"Nobody. Let's talk about it later.",
"Oh, he's very interested in science. You can often see him out in the wilderness with his spyglass and a bag collecting herbs and insects.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"He claims that he, in his youth, flew with a balloon made of old newspapers!",
"I see. I have a question.",			//88
"Thank you, goodbye.",

"How can I get to the Tavern?",
"I see. Goodbye.",
"I can't think of anything to tell you...",
"What exactly would you like to know?",			//120
"Please.",
"I'd like to know more about the colony...",
"Is there anything on this island besides the town?",
"Do you know anything about the Harbour Master's Office?",
"Let's change the subject.",
"#sRedmond#'s history? Hmm... The colony was founded about twenty-five years ago.\nThe island is rich and fertile, and the colony grew quickly.\nNow it's the biggest and most thriving settlement in the whole archipelago.",
"More...",
"Sounds familiar. Let's talk about something else.",
"Naturally, a governor from the mainland was sent, and a powerful fort was built to protect the colony. It's all for the best - you can't trust pirates to mind their manners.",
"Let's talk about something else.",			//130
"There's nothing more... except for a few desolate beaches and acres of jungle.\nThe jungle begins just outside the city, and a couple of paths have been cut, but there's no reason to venture there. Besides the wild beasts, there are also convicts and cutthroats hiding out there.",
"Scary! Tell me more.",
"Clearing the jungle is a hard work. That's why it's still a bit rough outside the town.\nBut the soil is fertile, and we have excellent crops. \nIn time I reckon the plantations will replace the jungle, and the town will be surrounded by farms, roads and fields.",
"More...",
"Hm.... There's a magnificent mountain range... jungle which is of no use to anyone.\n Desolate sand beaches...and that's it. The excitement is inside the town walls.",
"Tell me more.",
"I see. Let's talk about something else now.",
"I doubt I'd be able to tell you anything about it - I'm hardly interested in armies and wars.",
"Tell me something else.",
"Yes I do. In the Port between the Shipbuilding and the Town gates.",  //140
"I see. Continue...",
"Hmm... I don't think I should tell you about it. What if you become a pirate?\nOur colony might be threatened just because I told you about some weaknesses in the fort.",
"You sound a bit paranoid. Oh well, it doesn't matter.",
"I'm tired of this conversation. I'd like to ask something else.",
"The guv'nor, right-o?", // NEW
"That much-fabled smithy of yours.",
"Ol' Mortimer thinks he's the greatest craftsman ever to wield a hammer and tongs, he does. But if'n ye ask me, the bloke charges too high and takes too long wieldin' 'em.",
"Fair enough. And now for something completely different:",
"Aha. Mmhm. Uhuh. I'm sorry, what was that again? Devils, I'm hungry...",
"I'm told you have quite a fine smithy on this island. Where can I find him?",	//150
"Oh, a fine one he is indeed, captain. Though he charges a pretty penny, and given he has no lack of customers, you'll have to wait a few days for his work. You'll see his fires blazing near townhall -- same side of the street, just one door down, near the gates to the market district.",
"I shall bear that in mind. Good day.",
"How can I find the Shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my Goods?",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
"At first, colony of #sRedmond# was founded by the Spanish, but in 1655 the settlement fell into good English hands: houses was built around strategically placed fort at the entrance of the bay. Those hands seized town from Spaniards, that's true, but wasn't strong enough to protect it against possible Spanish or French attack -- so governor relied on pirates 'help'...",
"Thus, for thirty years #sRedmond# was shelter for pirates and outlaws; the situation was so drastic that the town was referred as 'Sodom of the New World'. There were so many of buccaniers and other cutthroats because of location of #sisland_Redmond# in the Caribbean: the island laying in the centre of Spanish Main was very comfortable for attacking Spanish shipping and plundering towns controlled by Spain. That was the reason why famous pirate, Henry Morgan, had his base here and led attacks on Panama, Portobello and Maracaibo from this town.",
"But since 1687, when anti-piracy laws were laid down, the cutthroat-domination period is over, and now the colony is rich and prosperous, one of two most important British colonies in the West Indies.",
"...",										//160
"I have heard about a Post & Bank is it true?",
"Oh yes, keep to the right from the Port. It's the last building on that side.",
"Can I visit it?",
"Oh no, civilians are not allowed there. And even if you were there's also a password.",
"The fort commendant, Lieutenant G.",
"Have you seen de lefftenent today?",
"Yes, he just went by. To the restaurant I guess.",
"What a grotesque tale!",
"De fort commendant, lefftenent G. ",
"The city looks so civilized. Is there any need for a Prison here?",
"It's on the back side of the Port Tavern. You don't want to go there - believe me.",
"Is there a good Blacksmith in Charleston?",
"From the Port just walk straight on to the other side of the Town. A little to the right he is.",
"Where can I find the Townhall?",
"From the Port just walk straight on to the other side of the Town. The Townhall is to the left of Mister Poe's house.",
"Is there a Church in this town?",
"Not a Church - a Cathedral! But it's closed for repairs.",
"There's always a Chinatown - where is Charleston's?",
"Keep to the left when arriving from the Port. 'Tin Ho' is a very good Chinese restaurant.",
"I'm looking for some textiles, is there a Tailor here?",
"Keep to the left when arriving from the Port. I think he's on vacation though...",
"Hmm, ehrr, where can I find some Opium in this town?",
"Take to the right from the Port. You have to balance on a plank to get there.",
"Excuse me, I have heard about the fatastic establishments... ehhr for men...",
"If you mean Brothels there are three of them but all are closed because of a strike. Very near the Gate to the Port.",
