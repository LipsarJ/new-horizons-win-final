"Not today, thanks.",
"Well I'm looking for some Navigation instruments...",
"Unfortunately the Navy's in port and have bought every single item of that kind.",
"Hmm, do you know anywhere else I can find something like a Spyglass?",
"Spyglasses have not been seen in this town for ages, but perhaps you could try with Mister Pym. He may still have some things from his early years at sea.",
"Is that Arthur Gordon Pym?",
"Indeed it is. You have heard of him, is that so?",
"Oh, just rumours... but only bad ones I'm afraid.",
"Bah, that can't be true. I assure you Mr Pym is a very respected citizen.",
"Very well, where does he live?",

"And the Tailor is..?",
"Very close to the entrance to Chinatown.",
"I see, goodbye then.",
"Nothing of interest at all?",
