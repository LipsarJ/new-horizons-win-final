"Wanna trade something more?",
"Not at the moment.",
"Ah, a visitor to my Office! Do you want to buy or sell?",
"I have talked to Lieutenant G. He mentioned that you maybe you are willing to trade a weapon.",
"What are we talking about here - Muskets, Bayonets, Grenades, ammunition or...?",
"I'm interested in the new firearm called Revolver.",
"A Revolver - very good. It will cost you a lot of money of course.",
"Hrmm, ehhr... I have this very valuable Sextant... - please take a look.",
"The Sextant looks alright but I can't give you a Revolver for it. Too cheap.",
"Okay, I'll add this fine Clock too. But then you have to supply me with ammunition as well.",
"That's better - but not close enough.",
"I also need a Long Rope. This is my last bid: you also get this nice little Tinderbox and we have a deal.",
"Alright, give me the Tinderbox. You'll have to fetch the Revolver in the Armory yourself though. Agreed?",
"Yes! Where is the Armory?",
"You'll have to pass through the Prison. Take these Keys - just lock all Cell Doors to get to the Armory - but do it in the right order.",
"Sigh, that sounds tricky...",
"It's up to you - I'm a very busy man. Here, give this Note to the Corporal in the Armory.",
"(Shrewd bargainer ehh)",
