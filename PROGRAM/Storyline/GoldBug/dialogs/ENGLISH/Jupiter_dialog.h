"Maybe we can sneak into de plantation at night, massa Will.",
"Yes, that's the only chance. But we need something to distract the guards with...",

"Hmm, the Plantation seems to be very well guarded...",
"Yes, look a watch-tower on your side massa.",
"Yeah, that way is impossible. They'll see me at once, maybe on the other side?",
"You go in alone massa Will?",
"Indeed I do, it's far to dangerous for a black man to enter this place. Maybe I can talk my way out of it if I get caught.",
"I see. Jup will do Firework outside, right? And look - they have a watch-tower on my side too.",
"You're right Jupiter. We'll have to get closer, keep your head down and follow me.",

"I go get one massa Will.",
"Very good Jupiter, I'll search for the lever again.",
"Did you see the raft down under de bridge Massa? Maybe we can sail around de bad guys.",
"Raft? Show me Jup but not a sound.",
"There it is, but how do we get down there Massa Will?",
"Hmm, I'll have to take a closer from the bridge.",
