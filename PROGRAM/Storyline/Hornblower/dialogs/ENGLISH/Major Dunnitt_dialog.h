"Wellesley! Pah! There are doubts that he knows how to run an army in a proper manner himself.",

"Thank you sir. I have orders here from Admiral Pellew and Colonel Wellesley for your attention.",
"Sharpe? The fellow that Wellesley raised from the ranks? You want him?",
"Yes Major. He is vital to my mission.",
"If you say so. Take him and go. He and his troop will be outside.",
"Lieutenant! Dismiss the men they will need their rest before the battle tomorrow.",
"...",
"Not you Sharpe! Take your men and see what the terrain is like for tomorrow. ",
"We have standards here. An officer must behave like a gentleman. Even if he is not a gentleman.",
