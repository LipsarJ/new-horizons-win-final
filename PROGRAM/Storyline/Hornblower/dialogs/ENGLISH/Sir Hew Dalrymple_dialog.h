"Are you ready?",
"Yes, I think so.",
"Thank you gentlemen, much appreciated. However, I find the company present and the conversation adds much to any meal. And her Grace can liven up any occasion.",
"Indeed, Sir Hew.",

"Now concerning you, Mr. ",
". Justinian.. Indefatigable.. Capture of Le Rêve.. Commendation with regard to the sinking of the Téméraire and saving us from the fire ship. Impressive stuff, Mr. ",
". And you were here for your lieutenants' exam eh! No time for that now. Things have moved on somewhat. Looks like you're just the man we need for this mission.",
"Mission?",
"Yes Lieutenant, mission. Captain Pellew and I have some top secret documents we need you to take to England. With all possible speed.",
"England Sir?",
".",
"Yes, Admiral. I can see that. So what is my part in all this?",

"Gentlemen. I am Major General Sir Hew Dalrymple, Commander of the Jamaica Station, here in the Caribbean. You may wonder why you are here, and why I am talking to you.",
"Yes, Sir Hew. We have our orders regarding the next mission.",
"That may be so, Midshipman.. ",
", isn't it?",
"Yes Sir Hew.",
"Hmmm.. Well, I am given to understand that navigation is one of your particular strong points. And if that is so, you will have realised that we are at the north-east point of the archipelago.",
"Yes Sir Hew. I noticed our course here from England, was closer to the coast of Africa, past the Caribbean, then one night we turned north west and made all speed for #sisland_Antigua#.",
"Very observant. Good man. The aim of course was to make the French and Spanish think you were heading for the cape and India. Which is why you made the final run mostly in darkness, when the Spanish ships that had been shadowing you, had turned back.",
"I see Sir Hew. But we are not at war with the French? Are we?",
"Technically we are not at war, yet. But tensions are high in Europe and war may break out at any time. Anyhow, that is by the by. We are in the underbelly of our enemies here, and with our main base in Jamaica, we can reduce the number of ships berthed there.",
"So they will think we are weaker than we really are?",
"Exactly. Which is also why you were only carrying four pounder cannon on your journey here. Another ruse to fool the enemy's spies into thinking our ships are weaker than they actually are.",
"So we.. er, you Sir Hew, are following a strategy of showing weakness while we quietly build the fleet's strength.",
"Indeed so. Our problem though, is to man these ships we need officers, good officers. To just ship officers in, would give a signal to the enemy that we are up to something. But Midshipmen, that is another matter. Nobody counts how many midshipmen we have. So you three, as the best of your class, have been selected for intense training and quick promotion.",
"That sounds very exciting Sir.",
"Yes, well, ponder it all. It will serve you well later. For now you must refit your ship with larger guns at the naval Yard. It is at the end of the pier in the dock. I have other matters to deal with now so you are dismissed. God and good fortune go with you gentlemen.",
