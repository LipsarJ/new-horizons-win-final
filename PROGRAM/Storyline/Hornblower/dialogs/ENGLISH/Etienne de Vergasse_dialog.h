"Hello Hornblower. All's well with you I trust?",
"Yes thank you, Lieutenant.",
"So, Mister Hornblower, her Grace tells me that you were careless enough as to sail your ship straight into the middle of the Spanish fleet.",
"...",
"Indeed I meant no offence to Mr. ",
" your Excellency. In fact I was going to thank him. If it wasn't for his unfortunate encounter, we would not have the pleasure of her Grace's company tonight. Indeed madam, it has been some years since I was in London, but I have the feeling we have met before.",
"After a fashion. I must confess that after Paris, I found it dirty, and the food well... But your theatre, on the other hand, is second to none.",
"The Rivals madam. That was one of the plays I saw.",
"Oh no madam, it is a comedy. In fact it is more than a comedy. It is a play about deceit.",
"You make two very interesting prisoners. The actress who pretends to be a duchess. The boy who pretends to be a captain.",
"I take offence, sir.",
"It is of course an excellent way of gathering information. The Duchess and the English naval officer, whose ship just happens to sail into the Spanish fleet.",
"I wonder what the penalty for spying is here. Death for you certainly. And for you Miss Cobham, I fear a similar end.",
