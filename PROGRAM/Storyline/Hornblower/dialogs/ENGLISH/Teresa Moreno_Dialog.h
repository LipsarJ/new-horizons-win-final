"Commander Hornblower. Caution is called for I believe.",
"Yes, Commadante. I believe it is.",
"So, I meet the great Commander Hornblower at last. I have heard much about you, sir.",
"Commadante Moreno. You do me too much honour.",
"Come, come Commander. I have heard much of your exploits with the French, and the Spanish.",
"Commadante, stories tend to become greatly embellished as time passes.",
"Modest too! An unusual trait amongst British officers. Very well, I will work with you. What is it you want?",
"Commadante, I need to find Major Hogan, who is I believe on #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"And will Richa... Lieutenant Sharpe and his troop be accompanying you on this mission?", 
"Yes Commadante, he will.",
"Good. Then we can accommodate each other Commander. I need a relic from the church in the town. We can join forces to retrieve it.",
"Commadante. I am under strict orders not to provoke war with France. Such an act would certainly put that at risk.",
"Bah! Your foolish truce! You think the French are sitting on their hands? By going to the town you will gain valuable intelligence, of that I'm sure.",
"But Commadante, I cannot start hostilities with the French.... My orders.",
"Not as a British Commander you can't, but if you travel with me as one of my band, you become a guerilla, and start no war.",
"Well that makes sense. What is your plan?",
"We sail to Anse Casse Bois on your ship and land on the beach. We then go and meet Major Hogan, then we go to the church and get the relic. I will bring civilian clothes which you and Lieutenant Sharpe will change into. My men will have sailed my ship around the island and it will be waiting in the port there. We will board her and leave, unnoticed. Then we sail round the island where you will reboard your own ship and complete your mission.",
"It sounds as if it just might work. Very well. I agree.",
"Then when do we sail?", 
"As soon as we have rested. My ship is ready. Let us meet on the dock in the morning. Mr. Bush. We shall retire to the tavern.",
"We are ready Commander. My men are sailing my ship to #sisland_Guadeloupe# port, to be ready to pick us up. They are also dropping two of them at Anse Casse Bois to scout ahead for us.", 
"You are well organised Commadante. Let us put to sea and pray for a successful mission.",
"My men are here now so we can proceed. Into the next valley turn left and on to the valley past that.",
"Next valley, turn left. Got it. Lets go.",
"This part is a bit tricky because of the undergrowth, but it's up to the fork in the path and take the left path from there.",
"Very well.",
"Good, my men are here. Straight on to the Plantation, Commander.",
"At last. This isn't doing my nerves any good.",
"There are far more troops here than the garrison needs, it's more like a fully fledged army.",
"OF COURSE! That's IT! It is an army. In fact it is an invasion army. I must get this information back to Admiral Pellew at once.",
"Don't forget your orders... and our bargain.",
"I know but this is so important.",
"Look, Hogan is in that big house at the back of the plantation. It would be stupid for you to turn back now without getting his information as well. You never know what further information he might have.",
"You're right of course. I'm just angry at myself for not seeing the situation earlier. Come on, let's go and see Hogan.",
"Not quite Commander. We still have the item in the church I need to collect.",
"Ah! Yes, the church.",
"Richard and his men have gone. I hope they make it through this.", 
"So do I. Let's get to the church and find this relic of yours.",
"I know where it is. It's in a room to the right of the altar.",
"Let's go then. To the town and the church.",
"Commander?",
"Got it! It's open.",
"Wait here I will go and get it.",
"Be as quick as you can.",
"I have it! I have the relic. Let's go quickly.",
"I'm all for that.",
"That was easier than I thought. All we have to do now is go to my ship and sail away.",
"...",
"Come on Commander. We must get to the ship quickly. We can just catch the tide.",
"Yes, you're right. To your ship then.",
"I understand gentlemen. Loyalty has mighty ropes that bind, and I have what I need for now.",
"Thank you Commadante. I wish you luck with your venture.",
"Thank you Commander Hornblower. I will meet with the Hotspur and tell them to look for you on the beach.",
"Thank you again. Good bye.",
"We seem to have beaten the Hotspur here, but I cannot stay here I'm afraid, I must get the relic to it's destination.",
"I understand, but I have a question. Your ship, I know her. I captured her from the French a long time ago. How did you come by it?",
"Ha! Ha! Shall we say Major Hogan did me a great kindness in getting the 'authorities' to loan it to me, to benefit our joint cause.",
"Ah! Major Hogan. I'm starting to learn a lot about him.",
"Well, I must go, but I will look out for the Hotspur. You stay here and talk with Lieutenant Sharpe and his men, I am sure they will tell you more.",
"Sharpe and his men? I will have to find them first.",
"They are here. They have been watching us ever since we landed.... Richard! ... You can come out now. We know you are there.",
"They're here?",
"Welcome, Commander! Doubly welcome now that Britain has come to its senses and resumed war against France!",
"Thank you, Commadante. I'm glad to have found you back here in Charlestown.",
"I still have my ship - perhaps you saw her in port. When your fleet raided Guadeloupe, I decided to leave the area for a while. Now, how can I help you?",
"One of my midshipmen, Thomas Wolfe, turned traitor. He escaped from a fight on the beach and ran inland. I hoped perhaps you might have some idea where he went next?",
"It might not have been your man, but as we were leaving Guadeloupe beach heading north, we saw a similar sloop, 'Loup-Garou', leaving port in a hurry and heading south.",
"And if that was Wolfe making for safer French territory, the only French island that way is #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. Thank you, Commadante. If that is Wolfe then I will find him.",
