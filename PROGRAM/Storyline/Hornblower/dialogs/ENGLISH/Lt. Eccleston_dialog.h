"Good day to you Lieutenant.",
"Good day Commander. What brings you here today?",
"I was told to deliver these documents.",
"Ah! Yes. They are in fact for me. More intelligence on the size of the enemy force. A waste of time now ships and men are being decommissioned.",
"Decommissioned?",
"Oh! You haven't heard? Wellesley's success in driving the French back at #sSt John's# and Pellew's squadron sinking five of their ships has made the French sign a peace treaty. So we don't need as many ships, or men. They are being beached.",
"Oh! no! The poor devils. That means half pay.",
"You really haven't heard have you? ... I'm afraid you and your ship are among those being decommissioned. You should go in and see Captain Hammond.",
"This doesn't sound good at all.",
"Captain Hornblower, sir.",
"Yes lieutenant?",
"Signal from Flagship, sir. You are to report aboard at once.",
"Very well, Lieutenant. Thank you.",
"Good day, Commander.",
"Good day. I was told to report here.",
"Ah, yes. Admiral Pellew is waiting for you.",
"I wonder what he has for me this time.",
"What can I do for you today, sir?",
"I'm here to report to Admiral Pellew.",
"Yes, I believe he's expecting you. Go right in, sir.",
"Thank you, Lieutenant.",
