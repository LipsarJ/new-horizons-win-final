"G'day... Hornblower, isn't it?",
"Yes Captain.",
"Lieutenant... Lieutenant!",
"Yes, Captain. Sorry, I don't think we've met before.",
"I am Captain Foster of the Dreadnought and pleased to meet you, no doubt.",
"A pleasure to meet you, sir. I am Lieutenant ",
", newly made captain of Le Rêve and this is Major Wellesley of the...",
"Yes, yes indeed. Well no time for all the niceties. I am in need of your ship Lieutenant.",
"Sir?",
"Pay attention man. I will repeat myself. I am Captain Foster of the Dreadnought, a very important ship in these waters, and I need to get back to her. You will take me. Do you understand?",
"But Captain I have orders to proceed to #sRedmond# and report to Admiral Sir Peter Parker on arrival.",
"Damn your insolence man! I am the senior officer here and I am commandeering your ship. I was on a supply ship and she was sunk by the Spanish! The crew was lost, I only just made it to shore myself. It is vital that I report the matter and warn our other ships.",
"The Spanish? I see sir. Where is your ship?",
"#sRedmond# man, #sRedmond#.",
"#sRedmond#? But that is where we were going Sir.",
"Good Grief man! Then why were you arguing about it?",
"Er... I wasn't arguing. I was informing you of my orders, Sir.",
"And I was telling you, Sir. That I am the senior officer, your orders be damned. Now... will you get me to #sRedmond# or do I have to shoot you on the spot?",
"I am ready Sir. We may sail immediately.",
"A fair journey, I have things to do, ",
". Major, I assume you will report to the Fort. Lieutenant, you will find Captain Pellew at the gates of the residence. I sent a runner ahead to inform him of your arrival. You are dismissed. ",
"Certainly, Captain. Er... Thank you. I shall report to the Residence gates, er.. I mean Captain Pellew at the Residence Gates.",
"Well if it isn't Pellew's young upstart.",
"You're close hauled on the port tack Mr. Hornblower, beating up channel with a nor-easterly wind blowing strong, with Dover bearing north two miles. Is that understood?",
"Yes sir.",
"Now... The wind veers four points taking you flat aback what do you do sir? .... What do you do?",
"Damnation! You took your time Hornblower. The fire ship, she's coming this way! Dreadnought and the Indefatigable are right in her path!",
"Sir! If we swim out to her we can turn her away.",
"Are you up for it man?",
"Yes Sir.",
"Let's go then. Hammond follow us in a chase boat to pick us up.",
"We've got to get to the wheel. The starboard gangway is ablaze",
"Let me go Sir. I think I can make it on the port side.",
"Hard a-port man. Hard a-port.",
"Aye aye Sir, Hard a-port it is.... She's answering the helm Sir.",
"Hold her steady Mr. Hornblower. We are clearing the Indefatigable now, so be ready to go about. We can put her on a sandbank opposite the fort, and they can blast her out of the water.",
"Aye aye, Sir.",
"Hard a-lea Hornblower. Hard a-lea, we're clear of the Indefatigable. We must get to the chase boat soon, this ship is about to explode. I'll go see where she is.",
" Hard a-lea it is.",
"Save yourself Hornblower. The chase boat is nowhere in sight. Jump overboard and swim for the dock.",
"Give me your arm Sir. We can jump together.",
"You were supposed to be following us to pick us up sir. I thought at least I could rely on a brother captain.",
"I make no implications Sir, but others may read implications into a simple statement of fact!",
"I congratulate you on your perspicacity Sir!",
"I would not!",
"We will Sir. When I shall expect an apology from you!",
"I shall look forward to that with pleasure Sir.",
"He will be most welcome.",
"What are you staring at man?",
"Nothing Sir.",
"My life is in your debt, Mr. Hornblower.",
"But not for long it would seem Sir.",
"Commander Hornblower. Your ship is to be decommissioned forthwith. She will be taken to #sOxbay# and worked on there. You will be on half pay until such time as your services are required again. And of course, without a ship to captain, you will revert to the rank of lieutenant.",
"Yes Captain, I understand, but where do I billet now?",
"Good Grief Man! Do you expect the navy to pamper you? You must go into town and find yourself lodgings somewhere. Good day Sir.",
"Oh! Yes. Good day to you Captain.",
"How could you allow such a disastrous event to occur on your watch. What have you done ",
"Sir, it wasn't my fault! We were attacked for no reason.",
"Not your fault! Not your FAULT! It is every officer's DUTY to protect his brother officers, or die trying, and you failed miserably. There is no place in His Majesty's Navy for a coward like you. You are dismissed from the service ",
"But Sir!",
"No more ",
". You are no longer a member of the service. Is that understood?",
