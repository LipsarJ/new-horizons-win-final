"You look so strong Mr. Haitch.",
"Hmm.. cough.. Your Ladyship!",
"Will I be safe with this lieutenant, Captain Pellew? He looks nothing more than a boy!",
"I Er.. assure you that I will do my utmost, your Grace.",
"I am in your hands now Mr. Haitch. I may call you Mr. Haitch mayn't I?",
"Er.. Yes, your Grace. I er.. I think we should make ready for sea. Good day Sirs.",
"How shall we get to England lieutenant? Which route shall we take?",
"We shall sail nor east towards #sisland_Turks# Island and then nor, nor east to England.",
"Hello again Lieutenant. Come with me. I've someone I want you to meet.", 
"Your Grace? What are you doing here?",
"Mr. Haitch. You seem somewhat distracted. Is anything the matter?",
"How did you get here your Grace?",
"Ha! the Spanish captain saw a ship with a British flag and hightailed it back here as fast as he could. He dumped me off like a cask of beef gone bad.",
"And the dispatches your Grace?",
"Oh! I gave them up for a good room.",
"WHAT!",
"Calm down Mr Haitch, calm down. Your dispatches are quite safe. I have them with me. Now come on, we'd best be getting back.", 
"Thank you your Grace.",
"Hello Lieutenant. I just came by to see how Mr. Kennedy is today.",
"He seems to be recovering, your Grace.",
"That's good to hear. Well, I just stopped by. I'll see you later Mr. Haitch.",
"Yes, your Grace.",
"I must protest, Sir. Those were not my words.",
"...",
"I don't recall it sir... Did you find London pleasing?",
"I heard it is a sad play.",
"You would know better than I. I am not often in London.",
"I didn't like that Frenchie. Not at all.",
"Why not? He seemed to like you. But perhaps that is because you were in a play he saw. The Rivals wasn't it? Or perhaps it was Macbeth... Miss Cobham. Do you deny it?",
"Why should I?",
"But why this charade? The whole Duchess thing?",
"Because I want to get home.",
"Where are my dispatches?",
"Hidden.",
"Give them to me.",
"Why? Am I suddenly untrustworthy because I am not a duchess?", 
"No. Because you lied.",
"I confess Sir. I confess to my foolishness in trusting this boy. Had I known he would sail into a nest of Dons, I assure you I would still be resting in comfort in #sredmond#.",
"As it is I am here imprisoned on this dull post with no one for company save an old aristocrat and a callow youth. It does me such good to speak with a man at last.",
"Perhaps we should retire to my quarters Colonel, where we may talk further.",
"What do you want?",
"Your lack of civility does you no credit sir.",
"How was your evening with the colonel?",
"I did what was necessary to protect my alias, AND your precious dispatches. It was lucky for you, that last night I had another card to play.",
"Your Grace... Miss Cobham, I am sorry. I spoke hastily. Now that I know you, I would be grateful if you would keep them for me.", 
"What! You expect me to cart the damn things round in my underwear again?",
"If your Grace would be so kind.",
"After a night in Mr. Hornblower's row boat, I think I could sleep on the perch in a parrot's cage!",
"In that case Captain Pellew, you should take these documents. Mr. Hornblower gave them to me for safe keeping when we were captured by the Spanish.",
"Don't be so hard on your acting lieutenant, Captain. If it weren't for his bravery we wouldn't be here today.",
