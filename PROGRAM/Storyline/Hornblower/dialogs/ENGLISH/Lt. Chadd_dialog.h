"Hello Hornblower. All's well with you I trust?",
"Yes thank you, Lieutenant.",
"Good day, Sir. May I enquire as to the nature of your business?",
"I am here for the examinations for lieutenant, Lieutenant.",
"Ah! you are the last candidate. You will find the captains in the office at the top of the stairs. You are to go straight in.",
"Thank you, Lieutenant.",
"Good day Midshipman. May I enquire as to the nature of your business?",
"Good day Sir. I am here to collect some officers joining the Indefatigable. Here are the orders to that effect.",
"Certainly Midshipman, everything is in order. You will find them at the top of the stairs in front of you.",
"It's a General Alarm! The fort is sounding a General Alarm. There's a Spanish fire ship bearing down on the port!",
"Good Grief! We must get to the ships!",
"Yes Commander, how may I assist you?",
"You hold the records of all ships in and out of port and the officers assigned to them do you not?",
"Yes Commander. Commodore Pellew is very strict about such matters. He likes to know where his ships and his officers are at all times.",
"Good. Then would you be so kind as to tell me on which ship Lieutenant Quelp is serving and where she is at present?",
"Oh! I don't need to look that one up Sir. Lieutenant Quelp had been missing in action, but was found to be a prisoner of the Spanish. The Renown rescued him... but you were on that ship Commander?",
"Yes, yes I know Lieutenant, but what ship is he on now, and where is she?",
"Oh! His ship, The Hound. HMS Hound under Captain Harvey. He was here for the Court Martial... Oh! Sorry Sir.",
"Never mind, Mr. Chadd. Go on.",
"The Hound left for #sisland_Cayman# on last evening's tide Sir.... Will that be all?",
"Yes Lieutenant. Thank you. That will be all.",
"Orders Sir?",
"Signal to the Flagship. Captain taken in shore action, report to follow. [Aye aye, sir].",
"He is right, sir.",
"Yes, I know he's right, but, by the time he's looked it up in the book...",
"Excuse me, Sir. You're to report to Naval HQ for new orders.",
"Thank you, Mr. Chadd. That will be all.",
