"Hey Boys! Look what the tide's washed in. Horatio Hornblower, Mr. Seasick.",
"Simpson, you just don't learn do you?",
"Call me Mr. Simpson, boy.. if you know what's good for you. I'm the senior Midshipman here. ",
"Mister Simpson. You just don't learn, do you?",
"As I remember it, I held my own when you and Clayton tried to jump me.",
"It wasn't like that Simpson, and well you know it.",
"So, want to try again, one on one, so to speak?",
"It would be my pleasure.",
"Blast your eyes, ",
"It is time things were finally settled with you Mr. Simpson, make ready.",
"I'm the senior Midshipman.",
"As if we could forget!",
"! I'm the senior midshipman. If anyone gets promoted it should be me! I'll stop your promotion.",
"There you are you sluggards. Get a move on, the Captain is waiting to sail.",
"Simpson, we are getting the stores and new guns organised!",
"Organised! Organised! Perhaps this will organise you faster then.",
"What?!",
"We could have been at sea hours ago lads. Hornblower and his little friends got lost in the shipyard though! Ha! Ha!",
"Simpson.. ",
"What a barnacle you really are Hornblower. Now the Captain will be furious because we didn't get here in time.",
"Simpson, you were in command of the jolly boat. You chose to come ashore the long way round. It's time you were called to account. I challenge you to a duel. Here, now.",
"Lieutenant, Hornblower and Clayton attacked me totally unprovoked. I just had to defend myself. I knocked Hornblower out, but Clayton..",
"Simpson! That's not how it was!",
