"Good day Lieutenant.",
"Good day Harper.",
"There'll only be one, Sir.",
"One? One what?",
"Body sir. There'll only be being one dead body. This'un here is just unconscious, so he is.",
"Unconscious?",
"Aye sir. After we'd had our chat I tapped him with me sword. Out like a light he went. Quite surprising for such a big man.",
"Did he tell you anything that would help us? Before he went unconscious?",
"That he did sir. That he did.", 
"AND?",
"There'll be another tunnel in the backroom over there. It leads to the Academy and the pirate encampment. That's how they've been moving the goods about.",
"?",
"Would you be looking at that now Lieutenant.",
"Looking at what? All I see is sea.",
"Ah! Your honour! But it's what's sailing on that sea. From here you would be getting a fine view of all ships in and out of #sCharlestown#, to be sure.",
"I see what you mean.",
"Well this is the pirate encampment to be sure, and if my eyes aren't deceiving me, two French officers went into the house over there.",
"French officers? Here? Something is definitely going on. But what? ",
"Perhaps we will find out something more when we get to the Academy.", 
"It's time to get out of here I think. Back the way we came.",
"You'll be wanting directions for the tunnel Lieutenant.", 
"Yes Harper that would help.",
"For the Academy, he said just follow the tunnel through. Don't turn off anywhere.",
"And the Pirate camp?",
"For the Pirate Camp he said go straight till we reach a flaming torch. Turn right. Then go on till we get to another flaming torch. Then turn right again. Then keep straight on.",
"I hope I can remember that. And the entrance to the tunnel?",
"That's behind the bookcase in the corner sir.",
"Very well. Let's get going.",
"Gentlemen, There's an old miner over there. I asked him what he saw or heard. He said he thought he heard gunfire when he was down his shaft and came up to look. But when he came up he saw nothing. He didn't see the bodies.",
"Thank you Harper.",
"If it's all the same to you Commander, Cooper and me would rather get back to the 95th. It don't seem right us being here, while the rest of the lads are under fire.",
"I understand Harper. Away you go then... and good luck.",
"I must admit I feel the same way. I will come back with you.",
"I'd not be meanin' to rush you, sir. But we'd be more use back with our men right now. A company of French troops just went out through the town gates.",
"Of course, Harper. Let's hope we're not too late. Follow me.",
"I'll stay out here and keep watch, sir. You know, just in case.",
"Good idea Harper. We won't be long.", 
"While I was out here I noticed a lot of large ships in the port, and those troops we saw are camped out there too.",
"Troops in camp? That confirms the invasion idea. I wonder if we should go and look?",
"He's busy fixing the locks on the town gates. That should stop any reinforcements for a while.",
"...",
"So far, so good, sir.",
"Stay watchful. We aren't home yet.",
"I'd hoped I catch you. You need to come and see this, sir. Me and Cooper took the wrong turn, but you won't believe what we came across.",
"Lead on then, we will follow.",
"We should go and see how Captain Murray is doing, sir.",
"I agree. We need to see if he can be moved.",
"Best I go on ahead and do a bit of scouting, sirs.",
"Good idea, Harper. We'll wait here.",
"They're there alright. But there's a whole squad of them.",
"More than we three can take on. We should return to the clearing. With any luck the other riflemen will be there.",
