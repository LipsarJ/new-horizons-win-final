"What other British ship is in these waters, sir? Do you suggest that we swim home?",
"I suggest that your ladyship return to #sIsla Muelle# and embark on a ship which has frills and fancies enough for women passengers.",
"A thousand people died in #sIsla Muelle# this week.",
"May I ask why you were in #sIsla Muelle# in the first place?",
"Because, sir, the British packet I was sailing in was captured months ago by the Spaniards. I was their prisoner until the alliance.\nAnd I must say that I was treated by the enemy with more courtesy than I have received so far from the captain of His Majesty's Ship ",
"Ahem...hem...",
"Exactly!",
"This removes any possibility of your ladyship's remaining aboard.",

"Oh no, not in the least, ma'am.",

"Gentle and warm-hearted. I see what he means!",
"<Shout from above> MR. ",
"Yes, dear. You've come back to me.",
"Oh, yes. Yes, my dear.",
"If I only knew how!",
