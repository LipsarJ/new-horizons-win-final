"Indeed I do, Acting Lieutenant, but it comes at a cost.",
"I expected that. How much?",
"100 gold coins.", 
"Per person. I have Mr. Bryan's wages to consider.",
"Somehow I expected that too. Here is your money. Now what?",
"Just go through the door on my right. You will find a tunnel. It leads straight to the beach. Bryan, move over.",
"Thank you.",
