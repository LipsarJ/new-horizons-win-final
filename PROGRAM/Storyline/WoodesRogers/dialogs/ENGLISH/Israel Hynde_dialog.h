"Don't you dare to adress a Boatswain in that manner again, you insolent hireling!",
"Umm... err... I see. Goodbye.",
"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here are my captain's comission and my shippapers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Alright, I don't know who you are or what you've been up to ... but your crew has been treated with all rum they could possibly drink in a week.",
"Well thank you mister ...?",
"Hah, that was the governors orders not my idea. Maybe you would like to visit the old mine young Captain?",
"Tell me more about the mine.",
"No, I have no interest in mining.",
"The Port Royal Mine was the very start for the city you see today. The owners of the first company got riches beyond every dream. It was a gold mine and one of the best.",
"Why have I never heard of this mine before? Why did they stop mining?",
"Even if they got an enormous amount of gold out of there, soon they ran into all kind of problems. There was a rumor that the mountain itself was cursed.",
"What happened?",
"In the first mine, the roof fell down killing a lot of miners working with a new lighting system - something with 'gas'.",
"'Gas', how?",
"I have no idea how it was meant to work - but some people were of the opinion that it was the lighting system, not the curse, that caused the accident.", 
"Hmm, and that closed the mine?",
"Listen, if you want to see the mine you have to pay for it. And then you can have the rest of the story ...",
"How much Captain? (That will do I  think?)",
"I'll only accept pure gold boy, money will not do!",	//22
"I agree to that, take this nugget. (What an idiot I must be ...) Now tell me the rest ...",
"I don't have any gold nuggets for the moment.",
"No the mine wasn't closed. They started to dig out the mountain in another direction, but the problems continued ...",
"Tell me more - this was interesting.",
"They digged to deep and another and bigger catastrophe occured. The sea broke through and hundreds of miners drowned.",
"What an terrible accident! Now I guess the mining business was finished.",
"Not at all. The tunnels were only flooded at high tide and so they still are. No, they dug even deeper and that is when the real trouble started ...",
"You can really tell a story, you know!",
"Well I ... Where was I? ... Yes, they ran into some sort of ancient cave under the bottom of the sea. The workers - they became strange from that moment on and refused to go down again. Now THAT closed down the mine finally!",
"What a story. (If it's true) Now show me the mine!",
"This way - if you're not scared of what may still be in the mine ...!",
"Me scared?! (Well - a little perhaps)",
"Hah, you'll come back, believe me. Now get out of my sight!",
"Even if I had some gold I wouldn't spend it on this travellers's tale of yours!",
"Maybe you would like to visit the old mine after all?!",
"If you find anything of interest - hand it over to me. And that's an order!",
"Aye, aye Sir. (Best to keep him calm)",
"And do NOT touch that single lever on the right youngster. I have had a lot of trouble already turning this system on!",
"Alright I'll be careful Captain. (boatswain more likely ...)",
"If you have enjoyed yourself enough in the mine sailor, hand over the tools you've got there.",
"Alright, there you are.",
"Now let me ask you - did you find anything down here - maybe something valuable?",
"No I didn't Captain.(Ok it's a trick, trying to flatter that stupid old goat a little)",
"That was really sad to hear - you know I can't let you out of here unless you pay me some gold. And I mean nuggets of GOLD!",
"Oh, you mean this little piece of gold?",
"Bloody unnecessary to sit here and rot - NO the apothecary hasn't showed up yet.",
"Aye aye Sir.",
"Alright, I don't know who you are or what you've been up to ... but your crew has been treated with all rum they could possibly drink in a week. Your ship has also been provided with rum and food.",
"Alright, I don't know who you are or what you've been up to ... but your crew has been treated with all rum they could possibly drink in a week. Your ship has also been provided with rum.",
"Alright, I don't know who you are or what you've been up to ... but your crew has been treated with all rum they could possibly drink in a week. Your ship has also been provided with food.",
"You're allowed to take any rum you can find in here - but you have to provide yourself with a bottle or a barrel.",
"I'll remember there's rum to find in this cellar!",
