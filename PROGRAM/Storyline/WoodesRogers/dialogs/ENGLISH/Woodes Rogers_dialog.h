"There were corrupt governors all along the Atlantic Coast. They collaborated with the pirates instead of wiping them out. But you don't have enough experience to be worth more talking!",
"Huh?",
"I never met him myself but they told me he had an Iron Will and fought like a Professional Gunman! I see you are a little more experienced since last time, maybe even been to jail!?",
"Who are you talking about and how do you know they threw me into prison old man?",
"Ahoy there young Captain, maybe I can brief you a little in your career if you come up here.",
"Sure, why not?",
"Rumour says he took more than 40 ships. He used an minor arsenal which only a Master Gunfighter could handle.",
"Maybe I will come back one day despite of this meaningless conversation.",
"Captain, I have something very important to tell you. Come up here at once please!",
"Hello there, I'm already on my way.",	//9
"It was Lieutenant Maynard who finally ended his worthless life. But enough of old times. I have a favour to ask you my promising young Captain.",
"What is it, how may I be of any help? (He's NOT going to hang me!!??)",
"My dearest daughter has disappeared. I'm far too old for sailing around the archipelago searching for my beloved girl.",
"So.....?",
"Find her for me and I'll be most grateful the rest of my life.",
"Hmm, I'm not sure if I want to risk my life for that...",
"In fact you don't have much of a choice here Captain Pyle, but I'll give you an extraordinary item if you succeed in helping me.",
"Well, this may show up to be an adventure after all.",
"You really are an adventurer of my taste Captain.",
"I have to know a little bit more about her disappearence.",
"She was heading for Antigua when the ship was boarded by pirates.",	//20
"Where did the attack occur?",
"The ship had drifted by a storm two days earlier and was somewhere North of Guadeloupe.",
"Is that all you know?",
"One of the survivors saw the pirates taking her as a prisoner.",
"Could they have taken her for ransom, you are not an anonymous person Governor?",
"No, I have heard nothing from her kidnappers, she would never tell her real name.",
"The daughter of the man who ended the piracy era is not worth much...?",
"Yes Captain, please track these bandits down before it's too late and bring back my daughter.",
"What does she look like?",
"She's a rather tall brunette and always wares trousers like a man!",	//30
"Strange habit but I will do my very best to find her alive.",
"I knew I could rely on you Captain!",
"Alright Governor, I'll sail immediatly..",
"I knew you could make it! Later I'm going to express my gratitude in a better way, but first Captain let my doctor see to your wounds.",
"Let's be done with it then.",
"I want to give to you Captain a very rare item.",
"That would certainly be an honor Governor.",
"You really have proven your courage by saving my dear Caroline K from the pirates.",
"Nothing to talk about.",
"However, to get this special thing you'll have to prove you are intelligent as well.",	//40
"I'm all ears...",
"It's in my bedroom and not so hard to find. Oh, and by the way Captain, my rooms are a little spread out.",
"I'll be on my way then Sir! (Come on, how hard could this be!).",
"I see that you have found the first pistol. Now to another subject: I am offering you a piece of land. What do you say Captain?",
"I am most grateful Governor.",
"Now if you please step over to my Lieutenant, he has the documents ready for you.",
"Landowner! Me!",
"Shall we continue? I hope that the repairs going on here not are bothering you in your search for the next pistol.", 
"Another pistol? Well okay I'm on may way again.",
"Be sure to find the Kitchen key before you leave for the next pistol.",	//50
"Alright, there is also a key to find.",
"I'm happy to see you survived the experiments of that maniac downstairs.",
"Hello again Governor, this terrace is really a nice place.",
"Indeed it is. Now to our further business young Captain. I'll give you a hint to find the next pistol.",
"(Even more guns!?) Guess I could need that.",
"Go through the loansharks office and the rest will be easy.",
"(Is he selling guns or what?) Ok thank you very much Sir.",
"You see I trade with pistols among many other things, but these guns are something extra. You'll see!",
"(Hah! I was right) To the loanshark then!",
"Ahh, welcome Captain. I guess you've met the poor fellow Selkirk?",	//60
"Oh yes, he seems to be a very religious man and ehh .. a little bit strange too Governor.",
"You know when we found him, he could hardly speak at all. Now to your next task...",
"(What is it this time!) Yes Governor!?",
"This one you'll find in my mother's room, above the shop. Now that will be almost too easy ...",
"(He's really having a good time with these riddles) Thank you very much for that Governor, I'm on my way again!",
"So there you are at last. Equip him with some proper navigation instruments mr Dampier!",
"Oh yes it took some time.",
"I have got wood and a pair of molasses bottles in my study. See what you can find.",
"(There's a lot of orders now!!) Of course Governor, I'll see what I can do",
"Please Captain don't bother about the officers being a little rude - they're all good men whom I've been sailing with for years now. Let me take care of that Dampier book.",
"No problem Sir. (What a bunch of boasting bullies - that's what I think!)",
"Very good Captain and if you don't mind I have some more books here ...",
"(Oh come on what do you take me for - a librarian?!) Ok I'll fix the books. (Do I have a serious problem to say NO?)",
"And one more thing ...",
"(NO NO NO) Well Governor I ...",
"Some days ago I made a stupid mistake. One evening, maybe after a glass rum or two, I lost one of the door keys - dropped it into the molasses tank.",
"I see. And now you want me to get it out of there?",   
"That would be very kind of you. It's not easy though, the tank is completely closed.",
"Alright, I think I can handle it. (Do I?)",
"Ahh you have brought me 'Notorious Pirates...'. As you might have guessed there is another pistol - and I'll give you this hint: Go through the Shop Office!",
"I'll get a complete arsenal Governor! (Maybe I can make a living selling guns!)",
"That's the idea yes! And I wouldn't sell them if I was you ...",
"(Is he reading my mind?) Okay - the pistols are real fine, maybe a little worn and a least one of them has belonged to a famous person!",
"Maybe they all have. Enough of this talk now - off you go young Captain.",
"Farewell Governor.",
"Captain, before going for the last pistol - can I offer you a drink or two? The crew's quarters is about to open now!",
"(Oh no!! Another one!! ) Well thank you Governor, where do I find that tavern?",
"Right in front of you Captain - hope this little game of mine is not bothering you!?",
"Not at all Sir! (For God's sake - Just let me out of here!)",
"Already leaving young Captain?! Why don't you take a glass or two!",
"Well I just ...",
"Get into that tavern and don't come back if you're still sober - you're among friends here.",
"Alright, (still doing exactly as he wants?)",
"... and decided to give you a little bonus help.",
"Well I certainly say yes to that!",
"However, let me make this very clear.",
"I just thought that maybe your 'imported' wares came from ...",
"I may be retired but still fully capable of ...",
"Well take it easy Governor - it was only something I happened to hear.",
"You are suspecting me of being a pirate??!!",
"---",
"You have found the last pistol I can see, but all that has to wait. You see this colony has met unexpected and serious problems...",
"I know - several citizens have been taken as hostages.",
"How's that, what do you know about this business - have you already met the pirates?",
"I was unlucky to run into them yes.",
"Then maybe you know where these bandits are hiding!?",
"Look Governor - they'll kill the hostages if I tell you - no they sent me here to collect what they want of riches!",
"Hmm - okay here's the list and even if there are no treasures they demand - it might be tricky enough to find all medicines and drugs here in Port Royal!",
"What? Medicines - only that?!",
"Shut up and listen carefully. I have made some preparations - all persons in my residence, family, friends and officers are told to search their rooms for what they may have of medicines.",
"And I'm the one to pick it up.",
"Indeed you are. Here are two bottles that I found in my bedroom to start with. May I suggest that you first look for a Medicine Chest  - maybe we have got one in the shop - Dave would know.",
"Alright - I'll see what I can do. (The pirates trade the hostages in exchange of some cough syrup???)",
"Very important is also to find my doctor - he if anyone should be here taking care of this medicine business - perhaps the navigator has seen mr Dover.",
"I'll try to find him then governor.",
"Do you question my orders Carpenter - ",
"- I'll teach who's in charge here!!",
"Greedy, that's what they are - all of them. I can't trust my own crew any longer!",
"It's the pistols right? I think I've guessed whom they have belonged to... But there's something more in it, right Governor?",
"Rumours Captain. A lot of rumours all over the entire Caribbean. I'm proud to see you have filled the Medicine Chest. Maybe you should leave at once!",
"Rumours Captain. A lot of rumours all over the entire Caribbean. I'm proud to see you have filled the Medicine Chest. Have you got enough of medicines or do you want to collect more?",
"I'll be on my way now to the pirates hideout Governor.",
"I think there still might be some drugs in the town for me to pick up.",
"Good luck then. When you return from that bastard Vane be sure to meet me here in the shipyard for your final reward!",
"(Oh I can't wait - wonder - could it be a PISTOL?!!!) I'm looking forward to that Governor.",
"First of all let me thank you for all your troubles with the Medicine Chest. If you go through this door behind me you'll get the last reward. Find your way to my farmhouse - that will be a start.",
"What can it be Governor? (Not a pistol for God's sake!) (Is he a farmer too now?)",
"Don't you worry, it's not a gun this time. But it will become useful WITH the guns! It was Lieutenant Maynard who first took care of these items.",
"Maynard - the famous pirate hunter?! It was he who pursued and finally killed ... ",
"Guess you could call him that. It was by the order of Alexander Spotswood, Governor of Virginia - and he gave them to me as an anti-pirate souvenir.",
"Well, I'm honored Governor. (Anti-pirate!! Is that so!!)",
"Oh come on, they're hard men that's all - I'm sure they would never hurt anyone of us. Now off with you! Oh I almost forgot, if you get stuck ask the servant Minerva for help.",
"I'm not afraid Governor. See you all later then.",
"You are doing just fine Captain!",
"Oh thank you Governor.",
"There is only one problem Governor - I have no ship!",
"You can use one of mine Captain Pyle, the 'Marquis' is ready in the port. But please sail under the British flag...",
"Well that was something!",
"In the Cabin you'll find the items you may need. Good luck on your journey Captain!",
"Not so fast Captain - are you sure you have picked up all the tools you need?",
"Hmm, I ... (maybe I have not as he's asking)",
