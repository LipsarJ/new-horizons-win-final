"Don't you dare to adress a superior in that manner again, you insolent hireling!",
"Umm... err... I see. Sorry for having bothered you, Sir. Goodbye.",
"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here are my captain's comission and my shippapers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Ahoy there matey.",
"Ahoy, ehh Captain?",
"Captain that was nice, but Miss Rogers to you. First let me thank you for your brave rescue expedition.",
"Oh nothing to talk more about.",
"Maybe you're not aware of your reputation around the archipelago?",
"Well what do people say then?",
"Ahh young Captain, have you found any medicines yet?",
"Grandma ... miss Rogers, only this locked chest so far.",
"I have sent for the apothecary from Bridgetown but it may take some time for him to get here. The boatswain Mr Pope is placed in the port to meet him.",
"I see ...",
"There may be some cures and drugs in my bedroom - I havn't had the time to check. Perhaps you should come back later!",
"I'll do that - goodbye miss Rogers.",
"Why don't you visit Mr Stretton, maybe he's able to open that chest.",
"Oh no, not that maniac - he could blow me to pieces.",
"Do you have any better idea, Captain?",
"Well, hmm I ...",
"Captain, they have murdered my son - we're all in great danger.",
"Miss Rogers, I have fought them already - but now I'm out of ammunition!",
"Sorry Captain, there's no ammo left here - but you can use your pistols in another way...",
"How is that?",
"Throw them on your enemies! And Captain, as soon as Dave arrives with our weapons we'll come to your help.",
"I certainley say yes to that! Throw them you say...",
"Now that was a fight! We got some of those bastards.",
"Yes you showed up in the last minute miss Rogers.",
"How's that? You should be grateful Captain - you could have been killed!",
"I want to thank you both. They were too many for me.",
"You go on alone Captain - we have to defend the store. There still are some really bad guys in life...",
"Yes so I have been told - Dampier among others.",
"Now listen carefully Captain! In these waters it's our custom to divide the pl.. ehrr booty between us.",
"Well, hmm I ... (Shit!)",
"I have decided that you will have three shares, so take your time and choose three items from that chest.",
"Ohh, I mean thank you Miss Rogers! (Yes yes yes!)",
"What do you choose Captain?",
"First I would like to keep the Map.",
"The Gold please.",
"The Cutlass please.",

"Now about the future. We'll continue our business in the Caribbean like before with the following promotions:",
"I take command of the 'Duke' with Caroline as my First Officer, Selkirk will be Navigator, Friday Carpenter and Dave Quartermaster.",
"We'll use onle the 'Duke' and besides that Dave -",
"- it's your job now as a Quartermaster to refit the ships!",
"Let me examine those items again.",
"I believe Minerva is fully capable of running the Store -",
"- what do you say girl?",
"You may keep that anyway -",
"- now please make a new choice Captain!",
"Claire has promised to take care of recruiting a new crew -",
"- ahh here she is!",
"That's a good choice -",
"Hmm, ...very well, if that is your choice -",
"- now make another one Captain!",
"- and that would be your three shares Captain.",
"Now Captain, do sit down please. Maybe you will let us all see the map that caused my sons death.",
"Very well, here it is.",
"Now please, can we get to the map!",
"It must be a tresure map with all this secrecy.",
"... and Maynard offered Spotswood the pistol belt. That make sense!",
"Okey, but why did Teach bother taking pistols in exchange for the maps?",
"... and I hope you don't have any problems with that!?",
"Of course not miss Rogers.",
"Indeed Caroline, on top of that I will also offer you Captain to pick two officers.",
"Well that was really genereous!",
"I rather think not Mister Pyle - hand it over at once! Are you trying to keep any more items for yourself?",
"Of course not Miss Rogers, it was not my intention to... Ehrmm, now what about Hornigold?",
"The Red Costume please.",
"Now to the Farm. As a token of our gratitude we are giving it to you Captain Pyle.",
"Ohh. Me - a houseowner!",
"The same goes for the Marquis. You may keep the sloop.",
"You are indeed very generous Miss Rogers.",
"We are also going to repair and refit the ship completely. If you wait at the Farm we'll sail her there.",
"Wow, thank you again.",		//90
"No Captain Pyle! We are ALL rich - as I told you once before.",
"(gulp) Of course! It's enough for everyone - I have made a great discovery!",
"Okay we'll divide the riches you after all brought us. Let me see... we are eight.",		//93
"...and my group four.",
"13 shares I mean. So you found the secret with those metal bars?",
"Indeed I did. You knew this already?",
"It was Claire who told us all about it.",
"Hmm, I'm not surprised that she's well-acquainted with Alchemy too.",
"Alchemy? I wouldn't call it that.",
"No?!",
"Now Captain Pyle, let's hear more about your great discovery!",
"!!!",
"That makes 12 shares.",
"Yes.",
"Let's here more about it later. First: what more than a damaged book did Teach's treasure consist of?",	//105
"First there was a chest with very valuable weapons. Then two chests with silver bars.",		//106
"And...?",			//107
"Twelve sacks with gold dust and two chests with gold coins.",		//108
"Anything else...?",			//109
"Only four chests with gold bars and and statue of solid gold!",	//110
"That sounds great, Captain! And a new ship too!",
"Well you see... there was a storm...",
