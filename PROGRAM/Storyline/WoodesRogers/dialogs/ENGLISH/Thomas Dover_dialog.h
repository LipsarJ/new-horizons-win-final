"Don't you dare to adress a Surgeon in that manner again, you insolent hireling!",
"Umm... err... I see. Goodbye.",
"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here are my captain's comission and my shippapers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Drink this you chimney sweeper and your health will improve.",
"What the heck...?",
"You really look like dirt you know! Drink this mercury potion if you have the guts, it may be a little bitter though... ",
"I'll kill you anywhere you prefer but not in this house! Now give me the drink (MERCURY!!! gulp) and shut up!",
"Alright, give me my Mercury Book at once sailor.",
"(It wasn't sailor-boy!!!) Sure you can have all these books, I've really lost interest in the library business!",
"Just do as you are told youngster! Here - put this stuff away somewhere.",
"One day 'doctor' we have to sort this out - I'm no servant!",
"Cure syphilis?! Of course I can - what do you take me for - a quack doctor?",
"(Remember you almost killed me once!) That's good news then, please hand the medicine over will you.",
"I have the cure ready for you, but you have to bring some empty bottles yourself.",
"Okay, I'll be back soon. (Wonder where to find those bottles?)",
"So you brought the bottles, Captain. Now take this remedy for curing syphilis.",
"What is it?",
"What it is? But Captain you really are such an ignoramous! It's Mercury of course - heard of it perhaps!?",
"Of course I have. (And experienced it too!) I just didn't know what it was good for.",
"No, I can hear that. Now also take this drawer - I think it may fit in that medicine chest of yours ... ",
"I see. (He stole it earlier I guess.) Hmm, thank you doctor.",
"Oh come on Captain: the bottles are not enough - bring the medicine chest (you idiot!)",
"What was that (did I hear idiot!)?",
"See what I mean now sailor? Take these bandages as well you amateur pirate.",
"We'll meet again 'doctor'...",
"What is it now!",
"Where is the Governor, 'doctor'?",
"He's in the Residence dirty sailor.",
"And where is the Residence if I may ask? (I'll kill you one day...)",
"Something wrong with your eyes too Captain? The GREEN DOUBLEDOORS are right in front of you!",
"Hrmpff (stupid idiot!!)",
