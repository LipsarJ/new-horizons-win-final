"The path of piracy leads only to damnation my son!",
"Umm... err... I see. Sorry for having bothered you. Goodbye.",
"Welcome my son, I've been waiting for you.",
"I have seen you here before, who the hell are YOU?",
"Watch your tongue Captain, I'm just a simple sailor who has found God.",
"You're the man who was marooned, and was saved after years and years of being on that island all alone , right?",
"Indeed I was, but I found company in the bible my son. Then Governor Woodes Rogers arrived with the ships Duke and Duchess after 4 years.",
"I have heard about you, isn't there a novel based on your adventure?",
"Not yet, but the writer Daniel De Foe is said to be working on something. Another thing, I wasn't marooned...",
"But but it's true you stayed there, on that island?",
"It is, but it was all voluntary. The Commander Dampier (that so called pilot, hmm hmm) and I argued about the seaworthiness of 'Cinque Ports'.",
"William Dampier is another famous auther too. 'A New Voyage Round the World'.",
"He's a little more than a writer, anyway the Governor not only rescued me, he also lets me and my friend stay here in his ... err ... err storeroom.",
"Yes there are a lot of goods in here, where does it come from?",
"I'm totally loyal to the Governor and his friends, not to his officers (like Dampier for instance).",
"I see! The Governor indeed seems to be a wealthy man ...",
"The path of piracy leads only to damnation my son!",    
"Yeah I know ... It was nice talking to you Selkirk, goodbye.",
"'Tah chaed um-rahkya sah-idi' means 'the young girl has returned' captain!",
"Alright enough of this, I'll go and look for Caroline.",
"Ahh, you arrived just in time to help me Captain.",			//20
"Sure Selkirk, what can I do for you?",
"The Governor has given me the responsibility for this library, you know ...",
"Ohh! (I didn't know he even could read!)",
"You didn't expect me to be able to read or write, did you boy?",
"Well I ...",
"Maybe you don't know I was a sailing master once!",
"Is that so?!",
"Now Captain to my little problem here.",
"Go on Navigator!",
"I have lost my glasses and without them I have no chance to read the smaller texts. Books have been moved around and things don't work in a proper way any longer. Please Captain, return these books to their right places.",
"No problem, just hand them over. (Not quite a challenge for a Pirate Captain though!)",
"And even better if you manage to find my glasses!",
"I'll see what I can do here!",
"Hello my friend, how are you doing here?",
"Hello again Mr Selkirk. I'm doing fine thank you - I have got something for you!",
"Oh, a pair of glasses - now I can take up the librarian profession again. Thank you for all help here. Let me give you some advice before you're finished here Captain.",
"Sure, what is it?",
"You're a clever young Captain - why don't you grab all the books you can carry. Here is something that may be useful!",
"Thank you - I'll follow that advice.",
"Ahoy there Captain! Change your evil ways and don't end up in jail, or more likely, get hanged.",	//40
"But Selkirk I'm no pirate whatever you believe.",
"In the Governors duty there are a lot of men - unscrupulous men with a very bad reputation.",
"Yes i have met some of his men and they look tough - but after all they're pirate hunters.",
"Adventurers, Explorers, Pirate hunters, Receivers, Antique shop owners, well respected citizens ... many are the names!",
"Oh come on Selkirk you can't mean that ...",
"Just let me give you this warning: There are really bad creatures in the tunnels, but they are only afraid of one thing Captain ...",
"Changed subject ehh? Ok and what could that be?",
"Open fire Captain!",
"Alright I'll be careful down there, and thank you Selkirk!",
"Oh yes, Fried-Egg reminds me that they don't see too good!",			//2 hints
"Fried-Egg??! How awful to adress your so called friend something like that just because the color of ...",
"Listen you clever young Captain, the famous Daniel De Foe wrote about our stay on that island and how we had both meat from goats and baked bread to survive!!!",
"Yes I'm listening, please continue.",
"Well nothing could be more wrong, the only thing we found to eat was bird eggs so there you are with your prejudices!",
"Hmm, I'm sorry Selkirk.", 
"They say the author is kept as a prisoner among others. I can assure you we're doing all to bring you the medicines demanded.",
"I'm glad to hear that.",
"The citizens of Port Royal have been ordered to hand over all what they may have of cures and drugs. I have put the (so called) Officer Mr Cook in charge to supervise that.",
"Where can I fetch that collection?",
"The people are gathered by the church bells.",
"I'll see to it at once Selkirk!",
"I'm sorry but I don't use medicines - but I'm pretty sure Fried-Egg has some strange cures - where ever he now is.",
"I'll try later to visit him then.",
"Oh you're looking for my friend and his medicines I guess.",
"That's right Selkirk.",
"Yes I have to warn you too Captain. Look out for Dampier, he's very ruthless - you know it was he who marooned me!",
"Oh, is that so?",
"The only protection you'll ever need my son.",
"Well thank you Selkirk, I'll be on my way again. (Oh no, now it's books again!)",
"Captain, you made it! You're safe here.",
"Where am I Selkirk?",
"This is the Governors secret bootyroom - the Officers don't know about it. Fried-Egg sleeps in here.",
"Is Governor Rogers dead?",
"My friend asks if you can swim Captain?",
"What?! Of course I can - why is he asking about that now?",
"Strange enough there are not many sailors that can swim Captain - they'll drown like rats if they fall overboard.",
"Alright, alright I like to swim, how do I get out of here?",
"Captain, before you leave - I have got something for you..",
"Oh yes? What can that be?",
"Now what is this Captain?! The Governor is killed, Caroline has disappeared and we are being kidnapped by this bunch of ...",
"Take it easy Selkirk, these gentlemen have decided to help us with Dampier and the other murderers.",
"Hmm, that's another thing. The officers and their men have all left. They've taken the ships. Can we join this company?",
"Sure, you and your friend are welcome.", 
"Very good! And how do we get out of here Captain? -",
"- all exits are locked ...",
"... except for one window in his room Fried-Egg says.",
"Hmm, that's very very high up, but it looks like I have no choice ...",
"Look Captain, I found this key ...",
"Good job - did you find anything else?",
"Hey Captain, this cannon is loaded!",
"That's fine, be ready to fire Mr Selkirk.",
"No, he's only stunned -",
"- it's a miracle: my bible saved him!",
"Fried-Egg found an open hatch!",
"Let's try it then Selkirk!",
"But grandma, we have no crew -",
"- the only ones loyal are the deaf cannon crew!",//97
"There is someone on the roof -",
"- says Fried-Egg.",
"A treasure map showing a port and two letters? And no more information...",
"No this is all (except the notebook). Guess we need more maps, this one isn't enough.",
"Blackbeard's treasure - are you serious?",
"Yeah, how could he possibly have any riches kept back from Hornigold?",
"Indeed I did Captain. Look, here's dry Gunpowder and a Sabre!",
"Lead the way out Mister Selkirk.",
