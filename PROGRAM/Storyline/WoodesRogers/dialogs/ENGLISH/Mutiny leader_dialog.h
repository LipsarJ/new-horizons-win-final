"Not you Captain: You are voted out Mr Pyle!",
"!!!",
"First you told us to leave the food behind - 'to keep the hold empty for all treasures'. We're starving Captain!", 
"The crew have their rum!!",
"And then you refused to take that fine ship - just because she 'looked British'!!",
"We'll soon find another prize...",
"Not so fast there Mr Pyle. Before you depart to your new island - hand over all your belongings!",
"What, you can't really mean...",
"As you seem to think that we can live on rum only - here have a bottle.",
"No weapons, nothing else?",
"You're allowed to take a weapon with you - with ONE shot!",
"(sigh)",
"This be MY ship now - ",
"- and I'm not looking to add any more crew!",
"A starving and deadly drunk crew -",
"- is a very dangerous thing!",
"Pirates attack ships -",
"- from ALL nations!",
"This will be a new experience for you 'Captain'. With no crew to push around you have to search all locations rigorously yourself for hints, items, new exits or anything interactive.",
"Yeah, and without us Officers you have to trust your own ability to solve problems and puzzles.",
"And Pyle do us a favour and stop your stupid talk about reincarnation - it simply doesn't exist!",
"---",
"It can't be true - do you have the nerve to make us a visit, Pyle!",
"So... 'The treasure is divided' ?",
"It is! And no share for you Pyle.",
"Well I have another opinion...",
"You know what's wrong with you Pyle? You have no luck!!",
"I escaped the godforgotten island where you marooned me, didn't I? And also I am the only survivor of the storm!",
"But now you've run out of luck, that's for sure!!",				//28 Christian
"Is that so?",
"Return to the other shore and we'll kill you.",				//30 Mills
"Is it a duel you are proposing?",
"It sure is. With the tree of us!",				//32 Young
"(gulp this is not going well at all)",
"This is a Duel -",							//34 Christian
"- are there any problems, crew?!!",
"Three to one, ehh Captain -",					//36 french crew
"- that's not what the articles call a Duel.",
"Looks like we got ourselves a new Captain...",
"...or what do you say men?",
"But this one is not a new one -",			//40
"- it's the old one!",
"The one you marooned -",
"- are you really sure about this??",
"Pyle, you will do. But no shares of our booty to you or your buddies.",
"Very well. And I will not share my treasures with you either!!",
"You aint got nothin' Pyle. A damaged book and painting!! You're shipwrecked!!",		//46
"We'll see, we'll see.",
"What about officers?",
"Israel Hands will be Navigator, Ignatius Pell in the tower Boatswain and Caesar Carpenter.",
"Blackbeard's men, eh? I volunteer as Quartermaster -",
"- as being the most qualified.",
"Don't worry Captain - ",
"- next time we'll aim higher!",
"... is anchored. But five Boats are on their way!",		//54
"No time to loose then. What's that you've got there - looks heavy.",
"It's the swivelgun from the Tower, I think you should have it Captain. And Mister Pell, if you please would enter the cliff to keep us informed.",
"Very good. We'll fire now at the Boats with all we got, Quartermaster!",
"WITHDRAW TO THE BLOCKHOUSE CREW!! Before they kill us all with them swivelguns.",
"(He's right but I'm the one to give orders here!!!) ",
"We're out of ammo on the roof, Captain. We have to fight them in the open!",
"I'll go first with the cannon and the blunderbuss, follow me!",
"Yes! They're all dead. What now Captain?",			//62
"We wait until dark, take their uniforms and try to fool the remaining crew on the corvette. Then..!!!",
"But Captain. Even if we killed these soldiers there could be many, many sailors left on board.",	//64
"Sure. And if we're unlucky more soldiers as well.",
"Hmm,... so...?",						//66
"The ship's a slaver, right. If we just could release the slaves and attack from the hold too, we'll take her!",
"I can swim too. Am I the only one..?",				//68
"Hmm very good, 'King David'.",
"Just a detail, Captain. The slaves are in shackles for sure. How will you deal with that??",	//70
"Well, I... (Why didn't I think of that?!) I... ehh...",
"Don't you remember, Captain? We have an excellent lockpick on board.",	//72
"The girl you mean? But I havn't seen her around.",
"Ah Captain, long time no sea.",					//74
"Very funny. I didn't see you earlier... (Crimson Pirate!! I thought it was me they called that.)",
"No, I was feeding the dog. What do you want?",				//76
"We need your lockpick skills. The corvette has slaves on board...",
"No problem Captain. When do we leave?",				//78
"At dark. But first, can you swim girl?",
"Don't patronize me. Of course I can swim - I learned that already in school.",			//80
"Alright Crimson Pirate. (tough one this, ehh) You must be the one and only pirate who ever visited a school.",
"'We don't need no education.' Is that so? I tell you what, Pyle. Besides lockpicking I can do anything you can do -",	//82
"- on top of that I have learned to read and write three languages and to navigate. Also maths so I could be Quartermaster as well as Captain any minute! THANKS TO SCHOOL!!!",
"I'll go first with the cannon, the blunderbuss and the grapeshot pistol, follow me!",		//84
"Don't disturb us - they'll attack soon again!",
"Ehh... I just...",	//86
"But are you really sure you'll succeed, Captain? I mean only the four of you against...",
"I'll have both muscles and intelligence in my group!",	//88
"And which of that do you stand for?",
"I'll tell you what frenchy, I didn't make you a quartermaster to question everything I'll do. I can make you an ordinary sailor again this instant! Don't forget that!",	//90
"Just one more thing - how are you going to signal to us when the slaves are ready to attack?",		//91
"Don't you worry. I'll work that out. (And start to get really, really tired of you) Even if I have to send a swimmer ashore!",
"Yes, what is it now?",
"Ehh... nothing.",
"I'm still here.",
"Good to know.",
"I'll start with the shackles then...",
"Yes, very good.",
"What now Captain? All prisoners are free.",
"Excellent, Crimson Pirate (hmm!). Now it's time for you to swim to shore. Please hurry up.",
"I see you found the ammo Captain, but how are we going to organize the attack?",
"Just a second, King...",
"Look at us. Do you really think we would work on a slaver -",	//103
"- my black friend Caesar here is even an Officer!",
"Now we've got all officer we need -",			//105
"- except for a sawbones.",
"",				//107
"",
"Sounds familiar somehow ... but tell me -",		//109
"- why are you wearing that mask?",
"That would be Isla Mona, Captain.",			//111
"!!!",
