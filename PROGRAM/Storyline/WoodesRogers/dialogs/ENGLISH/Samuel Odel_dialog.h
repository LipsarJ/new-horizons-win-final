"I have no business with you.",
"Take it easy, Mister Odel. I just want ask you a question.",
"No no no, Captain. I will never sign articles again!",
"You think I'm a pirate?",
"I recognize you from the maroon-painting. Howard Pyle I think it was...",
"Very well. (Yes! I'm famous!)",
"... famous for being the most unsuccessful pirate ever.",
"(Sigh) You were with Blackbeard at Ocracoke Island when he was killed, yes?",
"I was there??!! I recieved over seventy wounds and was accused of piracy.",
"Do you remember the navigator Israel Hands?",
"Do you remember the lieutenant Richards?",		//10
"Do you remember any crewmember called Johnson?",
"Do you remember Caesar, a black man?",
"Hands stayed on shore - wounded.",
"Okay. Let me ask you another question.",
"Yes, what is it now?",
"No, he wasn't there.",
"There was no Johnson in the crew.",
"Indeed I do - he almost killed us all...",
"What happened?",					
"That was tough. May I ask you a question or two now?",	//20
"Alright, but hurry up.",
"On November 22 1718, Lieutenant Maynard arrived with two sloops, the Jane and the Ranger to Ocracoke Island.",
"How did he found Blackbeard?",
"Governor Spotswood of Virginia had spies all along the coast. Now all three sloops ran a-ground in the shallow waters.",
"They fired at each other..?",
"Maynard's sloops were out of reach from Teach's cannons but could get free any minute. I was at the helm when Teach called for his most trusted crewmember, black Caesar.",
"Yes..?",
"...and the rest is well known.",
"Yes, but was it you that stopped Caesar from blowing the sloop to pieces? The Hold was locked.",
"I have other things to attend do now. But yes it was me, I found another way down.",		//30
"Just one more question, please. Caesar was taken prisoner but what happened to the sloop?",
"Lieutenant Maynard was allowed to keep it as a reward for defeating Blackbeard.",
"Aha, and do you have any idea where he lives today, if he's still alive?",
"I heard he's retired and living in an old Citadel on Eleuthera.",
"Thank you very much, Mister Odel.",		//35
"Our conversation is over, Howard Pyle.",
"Very well.",
"Do you remember Caesar here?",
"Well, with that company! And besides that...",
"Yes, what else?",				//40
"Eleuthera is a large island. Do I have to sail all along the coast and look for the Citadel?",
"No, I think you can reach it from the Tavern.",
