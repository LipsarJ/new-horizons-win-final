"Well that sounds good, hand them over please.",
"Not so fast captain, Woodes Rogers promised something in exchange for these cures.",
"Oh he did, and what would that be ...?",
"He said he could get me a violin, and that it would be an instrument of highest available quality.",
"A violin!!! (Where can I get that?!) Alright I'll see what I can do.",
"A violin you succeded in finding me a violin! Let me see it can't be - a Stratocastrius?!!!!",
"Sure it is, now please hand over those medicines will you.",
"I'll take care of that fine instrument immediately.",
"Well I think not... what about the bottles?",
"You'll need the medicine chest to carry all this stuff - why don't you come back later and pick them up?!",
"Alright I'll be back with the chest and you have to wait for the violin until then!.",
