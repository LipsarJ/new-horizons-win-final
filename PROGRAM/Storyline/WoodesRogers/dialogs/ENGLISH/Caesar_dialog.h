"Mister Hands!",
"?",
"Mister Hands and Mister Pell!",
"Governor Eden saved me in the last minute. But who's the new Captain?",
"I'm Howard Pyle. Why did Eden let you live?",
"Shut up Hennington -",
"- this is none of your business!",
"The Governor guessed that I had got a map from Teach too. He pressed me to find out where it was.",
"And you revealed it?",
"No. I lost it during the final battle. And that's the truth.",
"I see. Did you ever notice where the Governor kept his own map?",	//10
"No, maybe in his office. We servants were never allowed to enter.",
"I am interested in buying the Estate. Can I take a look inside?",
"This man is a thief Mrs Pough. If you don't believe me -",
"- ask him what he was doing in the Governors study.",
"Hah, I'm just leaving this place -",						//15
"- together with my friends!",
"I'll follow you.",
"Very good.",
"Okay, let's talk about the map, Captain Pyle.",		//19
"You've got it?! We are one step closer then.",
"I want a share of the treasure if you find it.",
"Of course - equal shares for all. Now hand it over.",
"Well Captain Pyle, what have you found out so far?",
"I have found the wreck of Teach's last sloop.",		//24
"Did you search the Hold?",
"Yes, and even the Gunpowder Storage if you should have hidden it there.",
"But I did. What did you find?",
"Nothing but Gunpowder.",
"Hmm, maybe it's still there under the Gunpowder.",
"Let's go to Turks then!",					//30
"I know that Teach's sloop was sold to a trader in Turks.",
"And more..?",
"I've talked to him but havn't found the wreck yet.",
"I placed the map in the Gunpowder Storage. Maybe it's still there.",
"I havn't found the wreck in Turks yet.",			//35
"Lieutenant Maynard got the sloop as a reward. He lives in Citadel Rock on Eleuthera island.",
"Let's go to Eleuthera then!",
"Maybe Samuel Odel from Smugglers Lair on La Grenade knows what happened to the Sloop.",
"Let's go to La Grenade then!",
"And there's no other way to get into the Office?",				//40
"There's someone coming this way, Captain.",			//41
"Indeed, and in a great hurry too.",
"He's a good runner, that guy.",				//43
"Yes, for someone with a pegleg. ",
"Pegleg - wait a minute, it looks like...",				//45
"... Israel Hands!",
"Welcome back Mister Hands. Here, we've got weapons for you. Now we're three survivors!",	//47
"Four Caesar four! The Boatswain is here too.",
"Mister Pell? Where is he?",					//49
"He thought he saw something at sea so he climbed the Tower to take a better look.",
"By the way - look what I found in the sand, Captain.",		//51
"My Belt and the Painting too!!",
"'Rich as trolls', that was a new one. Lead the way Captain, to the Treasure in the mountain.",	//53
"Hmm, we can't enter that way. We'll be killed by a deadly trap. But there's a secret entrance from the sea to Teach's cave.",
"The last sacks are aboard. We have to hurry, Captain. Mister Hands is worried about the weather...",		//55
"Yeah yeah. Let's go.",
"Captain, it's open to the slave deck!",	//57
"Very good, Caesar. You and King, go and get all the weapons you can carry.",
"It's no use Captain - the planks are nailed to the deck.",		//59
"Alright - we'll have to find another way in then.",
"We've got 'em weapons, Captain.",		//61
"That was fast.",
"Alright, but I can't say which Island it is, Captain.",			//63
"How is that? Let me take a closer look.",
