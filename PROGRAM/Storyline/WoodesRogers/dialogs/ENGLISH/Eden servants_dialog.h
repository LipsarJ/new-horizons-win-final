"Welcome Sir. I guess you're interested in buying the Estate.",
"Maybe. Or maybe I'll just have a look.",
"Feel free to look around.",
"Very good.",
"Wait a minute - your name is Caesar now? And you are acquainted with these 'gentlemen' -",
"- or should I say gentlemen of fortune?!",
"Yes, many doors are locked. But we're not trusted with the keys. Only Mrs Pough, the owner, has them.",
"And where do I find her?",
"She's probably in the garden house. The exit is behind the curtain in the Hall.",
"Okay, I'll find it.",
"What are you doing? You have killed those men!! Captain Courtney was interested in buying the Estate too...",
"Not any longer, that 'Captain' was a very dangerous person.",
"No my good man, you're the thief here -",
"- a thief or should I say a pirate hiding under a false name. Right Mister Caesar?",
"Pirates!!",
"Yeah, yeah we have heard that.",
