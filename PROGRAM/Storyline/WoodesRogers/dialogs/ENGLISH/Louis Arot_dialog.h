"Who's there?!!",
"Umm... err... I'm the one who hoisted the flags.",
"Maybe you are. Have you got it?",
"What are you talking about - why don't you let me in instead?",
"The book! Do you have his logbook?",
"You mean Blackbeard? Yes I've got it. Right here.",
"Throw it down to me then.",
"Through the chimney? This is very strange...",
"Just do it - or I can't help you.",
"Very well. Look out, here it comes!",
"No, I don't have any logbook at all.",			//10
"Then I can't help you. Goodbye.",
"!!! (Sigh)",
"Yes! Finally I've got it!",
"Good to hear, maybe we can talk now?",
"Ehh yes... of course... just a second. I'll open the door.",
"I'm on my way.",
"Louis Arot, at your service Monsieur...",
"Pyle. Captain Howard Pyle.",
"Of course, a pirate!! What did I expect in a business like this.",
"Do you have a problem with that? (I'm famous?)",	//20
"Pirates was the reason I ended up on this miserable islet. But I'm a free man from today!",
"Because a ship arrived?",
"I have seen many ships. No, because I got my hands on that cursed logbook!",
"How's that?",
"Seven years ago I was a cabin boy on the french slaver La Concorde...",
"The ship Hornigold and Teach captured.",
"Yes it was the ship Teach changed to Queen Anne's Revenge.",
"Let me guess: you were forced to join the pirates?",
"No. Some of the more useful cremembers were. No it was worse...",
"You volunteered. And became a pirate.",					//30
"Yes. You have to understand: Captain Dosset and his officers were very cruel men.",
"So you preferred the pirates company.",
"At the time I did, yes.",
"But it backfired, Teach had your name as a voluntary pirate in his logbook.",
"Yes. When I wanted to leave the pirates Teach came up with this 'solution'.",
"To place you here. Strange he let someone go...",
"He remembered I was the one who showed them where the gold dust was hidden in La Concorde.",
"He had another reason to maroon you here. To guard something for him?",
"The chest yes.",
"The chest for a logbook, right?",			//40
"That was the deal. I hope you can open it...",
"No problem, now show me the Chest.",
"It's on the upper 'floor'. One more thing Capitaine Pyle, I want to keep the Tartane.",
"Take it.",	
"I will also need the flags you've got. Can't sail around the archipelago with Blackbeard's colors!",
"Alright, here you are.",	
"Please hurry up Capitaine, so we can leave this place.",
"Alright, just a minute.",
"The new colors are better, ehh Capitaine?",
"Swedish - why not, in these waters.",			//50
