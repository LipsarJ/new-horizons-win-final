"Who are you monsieur?",
"Sorry for this intrusion, My name is Howard Pyle. Are you one of the surgeons from La Concorde?",
"Oh not the Blackbeard business again. We have all been to court and aquitted.",
"I see, but I have another question. What do you remember of Teach's lieutenant 'Richards'?",
"Not much, but a very tough guy for sure.",
"Maybe you medicated him?",
"No. I was the second surgeon and responsible for all the surgery - not the medicines.",
"Do you know where I can find any of the other surgeons from La Concorde?",
"Try the gunsmith - he served as a third surgeon.",
"Where's the gunsmith?",
"Enough with questions now. Please leave my house.",		//10
"Very well. Goodbye.",
"Welcome monsieur, you need help with a pistol or a musket maybe?",
"None, I just need some information if you please.",
"Hmm, I'm a very busy man.",
"Just a quick question then. I've got to know you once were forced into Teach's crew monsieur.",
"Oh oh, here we go again...",
"I'm only interested in Teach's lieutenant 'Richards'.",
"Yes, I remember him. He was ill but I made no surgery on him.",
"What did he suffer from?",
"How should I know - I just saw bones now and then.",	//20
"There were three or four surgeons I have heard. Do you know where any of the others can be found?",
"The first surgeon lives on top of the sailmaker's workshop.",
"And where is that?",
"What is this - a burglary?",
"Not at all. I only wish to speak with you monsieur.",
"Very well, what is it?",
"You were the first surgeon on La Concorde?",
"I can't believe it. Again and again this unfortunate story. I am not and have never been a pirate!!",
"No no no. I just want to ask you a question about one 'Richards' in Blackbeard's crew.",
"What about him?",	//30
"He was ill is that so?",
"Indeed he was. Syphilis like so many of those bastards.",
"And you treated him, monsieur?",
"I ordered some medicines for those guys yes.",
"Did you talk to him? Do you know what happened to him afterwards?",
"Certainly not monsieur. As the surgeon major I left all that to my assistent.",
"And maybe you know where I can find him?",
"Last time I heard of him he slept in a carriage somewhere in the town.",
"I am most grateful for your patience, monsieur.",	
"Aha, a visitor. And who might you be?",			//40
"Sorry to intrude Governor, my name is Howard Pyle.",
"The pirate!!",
"Not at all Sir - must be a coincidence. I am looking for the surgeon 'Nicholas'.",
"Nicholas Gautrain, at your service monsieur.",
"I have a few questions about the time when you served under Captain Teach.",
"Oh for god's sake, we were forced to join his crew.",
"Monsieur Gautrain, I'm only interested in Teach's lieutenant 'Richards'.",
"Yes, that one.",
"Did you talk to him?",
"Of course. Being one of the very sick pirates he was my patient.",	//50
"Do you know what became of him?",
"Not sure, but he talked about leaving the company.",
"I see... Did he tell you more about his plans?",
"He had a sister, monsieur. A sister who was a nun in an Abbey.",
"Please go on, this could be it! Where was that Abbey?",
"I think he mentioned Cartagena.",
"Thanks a lot monsieur for your time.",				//57
