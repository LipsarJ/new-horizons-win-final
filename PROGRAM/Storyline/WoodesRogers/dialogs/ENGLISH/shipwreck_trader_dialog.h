"Aha, a visitor finally. What can I help you with? Are you a tourist? Do you want to see the old Fort?",
"Many questions. But no, I am only interested in an old shipwreck. You do trade in old ships, right?",
"Of course, Captain. You have come to the right place. What kind of wreck are we talking about?",
"It's an old sloop. A small one.",
"What a coincidence. You're the second customer today asking for the same kind of ship.",
"(!! Are they really here already?) Hmm, do you perhaps know who he was?",
"No, he didn't tell his name. Looked like an officer to me. Not very nice manners though.",
"(That really sounds like one of Rogers officers.) Did you sell him the sloop wreck?",
"He wasn't sure that I had the right one so he wanted to inspect it first. This sloop should have belonged to Blackbeard, the famous pirate.",
"(Yes!) And that is the sloop you have got here?",
"Lieutenant Maynard sold it to me so I guess so. But I can assure you there are no tresaures left on board.",		//10
"Can I have a look too?",
"Indeed, Captain. You'll find the way to my ships from the Tavern. Go via the kitchen and upstairs through my bedroom. The earlier customer should have unlocked the bedroom door by now.",
"I see, if I find anything of interest I'll return here to discuss the prize...",
"What is it now?",
"You're the only one here? No soldiers?",
"This Fort hasn't been attacked in 200 years so yes it's just me here.",
"I see, good bye then. (Flying Dutchman oh yes!)",
"Sorry, but I don't have time to converse now.",
"Okay.",
"And Captain, don't you dare touch any of my personal belongings in my bedroom!",
"Of course not. (Hmm, that's a thought...)",
