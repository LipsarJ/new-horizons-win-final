"New here?",
"Indeed I am. May I ask you a question?",
"Certainly. Are you lost in Kristiania?",
"Yes, have you ever heard of a place called 'Blackbeard's tower'?",
"Ha! Everyone knows about it.",
"Is that so. Could you please give me some directions then...",
"Sure. It's very easy. The exit is close to the only brick house in the town Center.",
"(This sounds too easy. Maybe it has been explored years go.) Ahh.. right. And thank you.",
"The auction is over. You just missed it.",	//8
"Very well, I'm not interested in antiques.", 
"You found the entrance to Blackbeard's Tower you say. And yes, we have all been there trying to open the door.",
"It looked like a lever should be placed to unlock it.",
"Too bad you missed the auction today. Many rare items were sold. Items that may have belonged to Blackbeard himself.",
"(If I just could find the buyers - maybe  a deal is possible.) I see, do you know who bought these items?",
"It was some of the more prominent figures in this colony.",
"You mean rich?",
"Of course, the items were sold to very high prices.",
"Okay, thank you. (The auctionist must know who bought the items!)",
"Yes Captain, what is it now?",
"I wonder if you can give me some directions?",
"I'll help you, where do you want to go?",		//20
"Where do I find Governor Walter?",
"Do you know the password to the Fort?",
"Where is the Shipyard in Kristiania?",
"Where do I find the Church?",
"And the Tailor where do I find him?",			//25
"Do you know of a building called the Red House?",
"The Townhall is the big stone building in the town center. It's always guarded by dragoons.",
"Thank you.",
"Governor Hinrich Adolph Walter lives in the Townhall building.",
"Is he german?",					//30
"He was born in Germany, but his beautiful wife Anna Helena Trafvenfeldt is from Sweden.",
"Okay, where do I find the Townhall?",
"No, I don't. I'm sorry.",
"Very well, I'll ask someone else.",
"It's a ship! A swedish ship!",				//35
"Really. (I don't care at all - too busy with more important things!)",
"The Shipyard is situated in the Lower Town of Nueva Suecia.",
"Nueva Suecia - the spanish part of town?",
"Indeed it is Captain and the Shipyard is called 'Astillero'.",
"Yes we have the Chapel in Kristiania center and the Cathedral in Nueva Suecia.",	//40
"Protestant or catholic?",
"There is more than one church in Kristiania?",
"He's shop is in the Upper Town of Nueva Sucia. He's private room is the one with an orial.",
"That sounds easy. Good bye.",
"It's not. They say you have to climb the roofs to get there. But where do you start?",	//45
"Yes, I have heard of it - in the jungle somewhere...",
"Could you be more precise?",
"It's not the same jungle exit as to Blackbeard's Tower. But still from Kristiania center.",
"I guess that's something.",
"Yes, but be careful - the jungle is both like a maze and there may also be hostile indians.",	//50
"Thanks for the warning.",
"Do you know the way to the Fort?",
"Of course. You find the gate at the far end of the town center.",
"Oh never mind, I think I'll find my way.",
