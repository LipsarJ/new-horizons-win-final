"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"No, of course. I am a captain, after all...but I see you are not listening.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets. You can defend yourself, of course, if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such unbearable weather...and I've got to stand here in it. You may not believe me, but my only pastime is fighting the flies that try to land on my face.",
"That's most unfortunate, but I can't help you. It's your duty.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got my duty to do, and it's not my duty to talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",
"Do you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It is a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"Tell me some other time. I've got to go.",
"Go your way, don't bother me.",
"As you say, soldier.",
"Hey! Will you bring me a cup of rum from the tavern?",
"Perhaps. But won't they hang me up for helping a soldier get drunk on duty? No, wait 'til they change the guard, and then you can drink as much as you wish.",
"Why must it be a rough-looking sailor like you trying to talk to me?! Aren't there any beautiful women in this city?",
"And you call this doing your duty? Look, you wouldn't want to miss capturing some dangerous criminal like myself, would you? Ha-ha!",
"You look pretty healthy. Don't you want to join our army? We've got lots of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I'll have to decline your offer. Army discipline doesn't agree with me.",
"This heat.... I'd give anything to return back to the Europe, to the civilization...",
"Yes, it doesn't look like this weather suits you.",
"And the password is?",
"LONG-TOUR-AHH!!!",
"Hmm, I...",
"Long tory yah!",			//25
"Doesn't really sounds like it at all. Try again.",
"Long torah. (this reminds me of school!)",
"That was even worse.",
"The Commander is not in his office...",
"No problem.",				//30
"Red House - sure you know the right path through the jungle maze, sir? It's a very dangerous place indeed. Hostile indians.",
"Yes thank you. I've got a description here.",
"Hmm, you're right. I have no idea how to find it.",
"You have been warned of the jungle!",
"Are you sure you want to go into the jungle?",
"Ehh...(not really)",
"Did I understand that!?",					//37
