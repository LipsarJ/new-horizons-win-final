"And you are doing what in my room...?",
"I'm no thief, Your Reverence.",
"Aha, a polite intruder. And a liar. You're more than a thief. Maybe the Captain of thieves.",
"Reverend Mother, I'm a merchant Captain - that's all.",
"I was a privateer once that's true. But it was war.",
"Just rumours - bad rumours. I guess it's because of the painting.",
"Alright Reverend Mother, yes I am a pirate.",
"I was marooned by a pirate crew - that's true. Does that make me a pirate?",
"Too bad you have chosen to continue lying. Try again!",
"Privateer is true. But that's not all. Tell the truth!",
"But you are portraited as a pirate. With name and all! You had better tell the truth!",
"That's better. And you want this piece of a map so badly because you hope it shows the way to enormous treasures?",	//11
"Not the marooning part but you don't tell me all. Try again!",
"Are you willing to sell it, Your Reverence?",										//13
"Hmm, I wonder if you could do me a favour instead. But it's dangerous.",
"I'm not afraid. Tell me what to do.",
"I want you to collect the items I need for todays service. Return them to me and I'll give you the other half of the map.",
"No problem, Reverend Mother. Where do I find these items?",
"You have to search the Crypts and the Small Chapel in the Graveyard, Captain.",
"Which are the items?",
"A bible, wax candles, altar bread, a censer, a silver cross, a rosary, an icon and a relic. A total of eight items.",
"(Puh!!) Very well, I'm soon back, Your Reverence.",
"Ahh Captain, do you bring all my precious items?",
"Indeed I do, Reverend Mother.",
"Very good. If you only would change your ways, my dear Captain. The path of piracy leads only to damnation, my son.",
"Hrmpff...",
"Now to my part of our agreement - here take the map-piece. Fair winds to you Captain.",
"Thanks a lot, Your Reverence. Good bye.",
"Thank God, we all survived! And thank you Captain Pyle for your help.",
"Your welcome, Reverend Mother.",
"And now Sister Richards, would you please unlock the Cloister Gate for Captain Pyle.",
"---",
"Not now, please go away.",
"Oh, sorry Your Reverence.",							//33
"Yes, but why have you ripped it apart and where's the other half?",		//34
"I needed a piece of paper for a note. But I have the other part too.",		//35
