"Don't you dare to adress a Gunner in that manner again, you insolent hireling!",
"Umm... err... I see. Goodbye.",
"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here is my captain's comission and my shippapers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Can't you see I'm busy testing this piece. You have to find the ammunition by yourself, powdermonkey.",
"That's not a appropriate way of addressing a Captain, you simple thug.",
"I don't care who you pretend to be but I'll tell you this: When I'm done reloading, you better be out of the way...",
"Are you completey crazy? Firing a cannon inside the building?!!",
"So now yo're an expert on cannons as well? I swear you have not even carried a cannonball 'SIR'.",
"One more rude word and I will gut you like a fish!",
"Take this blade and get out of my sight now!",
"----",
"What are you doing here boy!",
"I could ask you the same 'Sir'.",
"Well I'm studying some ballistics, nothing strange with that!",
"To me it looks like poetry ...",
"Enough of this Captain, give me the book you have and I'll do you a favor.",
"It's only a collection of poems, nothing that could interest you and what kind of favor would that be?",
"Alright I'll take it anyway. There is a way out of here, let me show you.",
"Agreed then Mr Stretton!",
"I am ordered to help you, so let me open that chest completely now.",
"Hmm, hope you're not going to use any kind of tool - it almost destroyed the chest earlier!",
"No tools - I promise. So if you will turn around ...",
"(Why am I not sure at all about this?) And no damage either!?",
"If you're afraid you should have stayed in your boat senor!",
"Alright open it then.",
"What's the problem youngster? I've opened the chest and also found you something hidden in the back of it. Check for yourself!",
"Huh?",
"I don't think so boy, listen: your ship has been refitted with new cannons and ammunition as well - now what do you say powdermonkey!?",
"I don't think so boy, listen: your ship has been refitted with new cannons - now what do you say powdermonkey!?",
"I don't think so boy, listen: your cannons have been repaired and ammunition added as well - now what do you say powdermonkey!?",
"I don't think so boy, listen: your cannons have been repaired - now what do you say powdermonkey!?",
"I don't think so boy, listen: ammunition has been added to your ship - now what do you say powdermonkey!?",
"I'm a very busy man, come back when you have done a better job collecting those medicines!",
"Huh?",
