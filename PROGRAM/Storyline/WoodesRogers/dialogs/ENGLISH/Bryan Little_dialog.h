"Don't you dare to adress a Carpenter in that manner again, you insolent hireling!",
"Umm... err... I see. Goodbye.",
"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here are my captain's comission and my shippapers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Your ship has been completely overhauled. Not that I thought it was necessary but that was the orders from the Governor.",
"Did you find any damages?",
"No damages, and if there had been any - why should I care?! ",
"All damages, both on hull and rig have been repaired, just as Rogers wants it, not I - I can tell you!",
"All damages on the hull have been repaired, just as Rogers wants it, not I - I can tell you!",

"Incredible how you managed to destroy both doors. Hand it over boy, and be quick about it!",
"Alright take it then - but watch your tongue repairman!",
"Mr Fry to you - I'm the Carpenter, an Officer! Get lost for a while and let me work. Look around in the shipyard if you wish or go to hell - I don't care.",
"Just fix it, will you.",
"The chest is repaired - get out of my sight now. You have already got too much - that's what we all think!",
"Yeah, that's what you think huh? Remember carpenter that Governor Rogers is the one in charge around here - not you or your officer fellows!",
"Talk, talk and talk. He should never have given you those pistols - they belong to us - his loyal crewmembers!",
"What's so important with those guns anyway?",
"I have also provided your ship with planks. Now to that chest of yours...",
"I have also provided your ship with sailcloth. Now to that chest of yours...",
"Why the hell didn't you bring it? I'm supposed to repair it - stupid!",
"Well I ... (He's right, I have to get the medicine chest.)",
"Now to that chest of yours...",
"What about it?",
