"Hey there! Do me a favour young man...",
"Huh? (Is he drunk?)",
"Bandits have locked me in. Defeat them and I'll reward you.", 
"Alright, I'll see what I can do. (Oh yes very drunk.)",
"Watch out for the thug dressed as a monk. He's the leader of the pack and he's got the lever you'll need.",
"I'll be back in a minute, Mr Maynard.",
"Oh yes, that's a start. The Citadel is damaged so you can only get me out via the upper door of the tower.",
"Upper door yes. Hmm...",
"Use the anchor to block the bridge!",				//8
"Exactly what I had in mind.",					//9
"Finally. Is it sure you're not from a newspaper?",		//10
"Just a simple sailor, Mr Maynard. (He's stinking of rum!)",
"It's Lieutenant boy. Very well. I have a few items that may interest you. Take a closer look in my bedroom downstairs.",
"That's fine but I have only one question if you don't mind.",
"Oh no, not the Blackbeard business again!",
"I'm afraid it is.",
"What is it this time?",
"I'm interested in Blackbeard's ship...",
"'Queen Anne's Revenge' was set aground on a sandbar at Topsail Inlet, that's a well known fact.",
"I was thinking of the other ship.",
"The sloop 'Adventure' also stranded there.",	//20
"I know but there was another sloop as well.",
"Teach returned Bonnet's sloop 'Revenge' but completely looted to the so called 'Major'.",
"Still I'm looking for information about the fourth ship in Teach's flotilla.",
"The small sloop which he kept until the end yes. I sold it to a shipwreck dealer in Turks. And didn't get much for it.",	//24
"Aha. Farewell Lieutenant Maynard.",
"You again!",
"Oops wrong exit.",
"Where do I find the dealer?",
"He's office is in the old Fort. You have to leave the town into the jungle. Then it's to the left.",
"But how do I get to the bridge?",			//30
"Use the cliffs to walk around the bay, young man!",	//31
