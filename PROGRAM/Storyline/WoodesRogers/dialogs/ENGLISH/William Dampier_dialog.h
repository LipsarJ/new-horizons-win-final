"Don't you dare to adress a Navigator in that manner again, you insolent hireling!",
"Umm... err... I see. Goodbye.",
"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here are my captain's comission and my shippapers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Very well, take this Spyglass and an Archipelago Map if you know how to use them little sailor-boy.",
"Watch your tongue 'Sir'!",
"Oh calm down, 'Captain' isn't it? Since you're already working in the library - maybe you could do me a favor.",
"What's in it for me?",
"Shrewd bargainer ehh?!",
"Do you want any help or not!",
"I knew I could rely on you Captain. Take this interesting book and see if you're able to repair it - the front cover is missing. Come back here with the restored book and I'll get you something ...Okay!?", 
"Alright that's a deal.",
"The little sailor-boy - and he brings me my book! What an artist! What a fine portrait that is ...",//15
"Don't you ever 'sailor-boy' me again! Instead give me my reward.",
"Oh calm down young Captain, it was just a joke. I hear you're looking for a pair of glasses - my friend and colleague here is kind to offer you these spare glasses. Here you are!",
"Alright I'll take them for mister Selkirk.",
"Come back here with the restored book and I'll get you something ...Okay!?",
"If you don't mind, return this valuable book to it's right place!",		//20
"(Well the fact is I DO mind!) Alright, what do you give me for that?",
"You're lucky I don't hang you .... ",
"Oh stop that I'm not afraid of you.",
" ... SAILOR-BOY!",
"---",
"It's the mollycoddle again!",
"One day mister ...! Tell me where the doctor is at once!",
"",
"Well I ...",
"Alright sailor-boy listen carefully! The backside of those chests use to have some places for bottles too!",
"Hmm, you were right. But I ...",
"What is it now?",
"Where did you say I could find the doctor?",
"I didn't but he's very fond of new clothes and stuff.",
"Hmm ...I see!",
"Another thing, you don't have the slightest idea of how to open that chest do you?",
"I havn't seen Mr Dover today. Why don't you bring that medicine chest, maybe I have something to show you - sailor-boy!",
"(I knew it!!!) Alright.",
"Very well, I have recruited some men for you and yes you may take this spyglass - if you know how to use it little sailor-boy.",
