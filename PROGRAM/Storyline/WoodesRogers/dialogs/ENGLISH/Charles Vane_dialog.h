"I'm the one in charge throughout these waters -",
"- and I'll NEVER accept a pardon, not even a 'Woodes-Rogers'!",
"... and how did you get here?!",
"I'm Captain Pyle, at your service Sir. It was an accident in the old mine, suddenly stones started to fall down and finally the whole tunnel collapsed.",
"Polite young Captain ehh? And what on earth were you up to in that mine?",
"Well it's a long story ...",
"Take a good look around you - you're certainly not a member here. Spit out the story if you want to stay alive!",
"!!!",
"So if you please Captain ...",
"It all started some time ago when I agreed to help Woodes Rogers to find ...",
"Your story really has to be good after mentioning that name!",
"Well his daughter was kidnapped and I found out she had been sold to a brothel in ...................................",
"...................................................... and after that you fell through the tunnel floor right into our cavern?",
"Yes that's my whole and true story!",
"Well my Captains, what shall we do with this gentleman?",
"(gulp)",
"Now wait a minute, I have a better idea ...",
"(Guess I'm in real trouble now)",
"Why not let this unknown Captain be the one who collects ",
"the ransom for our dear 'guests' down in the cellar?",
"Well then, what do you say Captain Pyle - interested in a little mission?",	//20
"Never - I'm no pirate!",
"Hmm, what's in it for me?",
"It does looks like I have no choice!?",
"Alright I'll do it.",
"Get rid of him!",
"No, wait!!!",
"Greedy are you Captain? Be lucky we don't just kill you. Take his gold and all his items!",
"(Oh no, here goes my gold and my pistol collection - so much work for nothing!)",
"What are you, a carpenter or a Captain!? I've no use for these tools - please take them away from here.",
"Well thank you Captain Vane - and my pistols ...?",
"Yes your pistols - they look a little familiar to me - take a look Calico Jack - don't you think we might have seen these ones before ...?",
"(Interesting - but what is he talking about?)",
"I thought you were a man of my sort, the task is simple. We have already sent our demands to Port Royal, you just have to pick up the stuff!",
"How do I get back to the town, and whom am I to meet there?",
"We'll take you there, well go to that damned old governor Rogers - and about your pistols - you'll get them back after a successfull mission.",
"I want to see the prisoners before leaving!",
"I really can't see why, but okey then.",
"Now let me out of here.",
"Just one thing clever young Captain. Don't try to be too smart and lead someone to us - if so the prisoners are dead!",
"I see.",									//40
"First hand over your gold and those guns you've got there - they look a little familiar to me - take a look Calico Jack - don't you think we might have seen these ones before ...?",
"(Oh no, here goes my gold and my pistol collection - so much work for nothing!) And what about the mission?",
"Shut up you bastards - ",
"- or I'll shoot the next one disturbing me!",
"If you just calm down - ",
"- I'll let you all use the medicines.",
"Ahh the young Captain again - ",
"- please sit down and we'll talk business!",
"I knew you were a reliable young man from the first moment -",
"- please mister Rackham give Captain Pyle his belongings.",
"You have fullfilled your mission and got your curiosity pistols back. Didn't you get anything else belonging to those guns? Now to another matter...",
"Yes what. (What more with the pistols?)",
"You have fullfilled your mission and got your curiosity pistols back. Didn't you get anything else belonging to those guns? We like to offer you a reward...",
"I'm listening... (What more with the pistols?)",
"The captains here are very experienced sailors and have agreed to teach you a new skill.",
"The captains here are very experienced sailors and have agreed to teach you two new skills.",
"The captains here are very experienced sailors and have agreed to teach you three new skills.",
"Well that was something!",
"I can train your Basic Defence ability.",
"I certainly say yes to that!",							//60
"The captains think highly of you and maybe you have the chance to be a member of this party. ",
"Well it does sound interesting...(Straight to the gallows, I'll suppose)",
"We have discussed your story and there is one interesting detail concerning the Costbrothers - they had black monk's cowls you say!?",
"Sure, it looked like a monastary - at first sight.",
"Get us something similar and you'll get help from these 'brothers' whenever needed.",
"(Gulp another mission) Alright I'll see what I can do about it. But first, you promised to let the prisoners leave!",
"I always keep my word, go ahead and get them out of here - ",
"- we had to move them to a safer place though.",
"Who's there, and be quick about it - monk!",
"It's me Howard Pyle, Captain Vane!",
"Pyle, you're back!",
"Yes but I thought everybody around here were deadly drunk.",
"Not all really, but you've got something for me. Right?",
"Indeed I have, here - maybe these outfits could be of some use for the 'brothers'?",
"Let me see - hand them over Captain Pyle.",
"(It's Captain now!!) Sure.",
"Excellent work - the brothers will vote you in for this Captain!",
"Hmm, they look a little bit ... tired?",
"I'll wake them up - this is going to be real funny -",
"- see for yourself through that window ...",					//80
"That served them right! Now to another issue Captain.",
"(Captain means he wants something from me again ...) Captain Vane, I've come here because I need help. They have killed Governor Rogers!",
"Who did it - and I guess you're worried about your friends?",
"His officers murdered him - a bunch of mutineers!",
"Hmm, I'll help you but first to this little problem of mine ...",
"What is it Captain?",
"We're locked in here. The cave door is locked - don't ask me how.",
"Isn't there any backdoor?",
"Let's go down and I'll show you ...",
"Alright.",
"Gentlemen of fortune - ",
"- I have a question of great importance.",
"Two out already!? To the rest of you:",
"Who took the coins from the collection box???",
"We've heard about your 'riches' a hundred times - ",
"- how about the COINS!?",
"Please Captain Pyle you see how things are around here... Try to find the right coins and place them in the collection box.",
"(Captain me again - must be hard being a Pirate Admiral with such colleagues) I'll see what I can do!",
"Show me your wares.",
"Very well.",									//100
"Oh yes, I almost forgot it - maybe you'll have some use for this Captain...",
"Huh? (What is he up to now.)",
"You did it Captain! Now let's get out of here.",
"Very well. (Now what's that thing on his head!?",
"Alright gentlemen listen carefully:",
"We're going to do a night raid - and take a ship or two!",
"Mister Exquemelin is in charge of the defence here. Captain Roberts takes the way through the crypt and clears the wine cellars - meeting place is the mine. ",
"Pick your men!",
"Now Captain Pyle, show us the way you arrived here the very first time...",
"Follow me then.",
"We need a ladder here...",
"... LADDER!!!",
"Stop this stupid conversation -",
"- and take your new outfits!",
"Now if you don't mind, leave the ladder here -",
"- and return to the shore. Keep your eyes open and you'll get your shares of the plunder!",
"Now let's smoke them out like rats - ",
"- we'll find them wherever they're hiding.",
"Taylor you take the shop, La Buze the residence -",
"- and Calico Jack the kitchen. Let's go!!",					//120
"... but this time I'll make an exception:",
"Selkirk has a very good reason for joining us Captains - he's the one who was marooned by Dampier!",
"Listen carefully now: Calico Jack takes his group to the other side of the galleon - ",
"- you must stay in the water and not make any sounds until we have given them a broadside from the corvette!",
"Oh SHUT UP! Are you gonna spoil everything by this noise -",
"- put on your masks and off you go!!",
"Captain, the cannons are loaded but you have to remove that elevator before we can attack!",
"I'll see what I can do. (Always me to do the difficult parts!) Where is everybody?",
"They're on board the galleon, busy getting drunk - but watch out, there may be guards on both ships!",
"Alright, I'll take Selkirk as company!",
"Hurry up now, Selkirk's already started searching the corvette.",
"I'm on my way.",
"Captain Quelch, take some men and search that farmhouse -",
"- then guard the shore and kill all who try to escape this way!",
"Quick, remove his clothes -",
"- and see how bad he's hurt!",
"........ otherwise Captains hurry up now and search the galleon -",
"- see if there are any open doors to those hiding cowards!",
"She's going down, quick cut her loose -",
"- if you want to save the corvette!",						//140
"Damn you fools! What are you complaining about -",				
"- we'll take this ship instead: a CORVETTE!!! One of the best ships in the entire caribbean.",
"Watch your tounge Mr Quelch -",
"- or you loose it!",
"Let's get away from here now - so if you dont mind Captain Pyle...",
"My enemies are defeated and you got your corvette so I guess it's farewell then...",
"Unless you don't want to join us Captain. A 'Gentleman of Fortune' - what do you say?",
"Thank you, but I still have some business with the Rogers family. But It sounds very tempting...",
"Oh yes Captain, this is for you. A carrier pigeon brought it here. Is it some kind of code?",
"Hmm, I'm mot sure (what to tell him...), let me examine it closely. (something hidden in the game itself??) ",		//150
"Go on Captain, yo're doing very well indeed.",
"Ahh, thank you Captain Vane.",
"Just a detail - you can hand over those spare coins to me now.",
"Alright, here you are... (I thought they were mine!)",				//154
"What is it this time, Pyle?",
"Edward Teach visited you not long before his last fight, right?",
"What about it?",
"Did this fellow Richards accompany him? He was Teach's lieutenant.",
"Jack, see to that machine before you blow us all to hell!",
"!!!",										//160
"We have sailed with you for years",
"and taken many fine prizes too.",
"Return to your posts men -",
"- Calico Jack is back again!",
