"Hello Captain. I've heard you sank the 'Belleville'. Congratulations!",
"Thank you, Sir. So, we need to go to #sisland_Khael Roa#?",
"Yes. We have to explore the island and find a good place for a future settlement.",
"When will we leave #sisland_Antigua#?",
"As soon as the cargo is stowed, you can weigh anchor, I'll be on my ship following you.",
"Alright. I'm going to prepare for departure.",
"This bay is a perfect natural harbour. A fort could be built over there to protect them.",
"Yes, but the cliffs don't permit a town to be built in this place and water is needed.",
"Very true. For that, we need to explore inland.",
"I can't believe it! A camp is already on the island.",
"Yes and from what I see, it belongs to the French. Look at the flag on this hut!",
"You're right, but I don't see them. The camp is deserted.",
"Maybe, they are exploring this monument. I've never seen anything like it before, A bit scary.",
"I think it's a temple. I've heard the Mayans used to build like this on the mainland, they used them for sacrifices and to bury their kings - with all their gold.",
"Maybe they also built this one, looks like they left long ago, wonder why?",
"We could have a look inside, never know what we might find, there could be demons or ghosts to trap us.",
"Alright, but let's be on guard.",
"Fortunately, I saw them coming but we must leave the island. More soldiers could arrive. This place is all but deserted.",
"I thought they were ghosts first, but only French soldiers, Sir. We don't know how many more French are on #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"Let's head back to the ships. We need to inform the Portadmiral Lord Barham the French are already here.",
