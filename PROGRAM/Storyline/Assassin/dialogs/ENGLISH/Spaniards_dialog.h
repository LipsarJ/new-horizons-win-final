"Stop! What do you want?",
"Don’t you see? I’m Johan Elting, a mercenary working for Vice-Admiral Benavides.",
"Sorry, I didn't recognize you. And who's the man with you?",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"What?! The Portuguese pirate?",
"Himself. I arrested him in Eleuthera.",
"Vice-Admiral Benavides will be happy with the news.",
"Certainly. But, it's late, the Vice-Admiral must sleep. Tomorrow morning, I'll inform him. In the meantime, Captain Portugues will be locked up in the jail.",
"Of course, Captain. Please enter!",
"Yes?",
"Good morning, Captain Villalobos. I'm the assistant of the Havana's priest. I was going to the townhall because I knew you were there.",
"Yes, I was. What do you want?",
"My superior would like to speak with you. He's in the Church waiting for you.",
"Do you know why he wants to talk to me?",
"No, I don't. I only noted he was worried and wanted to see you as quickly as possible.",
"That's weird because I don't know him. But let's go, I follow you.",
"Where is your superior?",
"*Threatening tone* The game is over. Drop your weapons! You are my prisoners.",
"What are you telling? Is it a joke?",
"No, it isn't. We are pirates and you will follow us if you want to survive.",
"How do you dare threaten me? Do you know who I am?",
"Perfectly, that's why I arrest you. For the last time : Drop your weapons!",
"Go to Hell!",
"After you!",
