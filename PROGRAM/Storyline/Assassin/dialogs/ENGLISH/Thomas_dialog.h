"Who are you? Do you work for Santos?",
"No, I don't work for him. I'm Captain Elting and I came to kill him and free Camille Leone. But, what are you doing here?",
"I'm Thomas the Terror, the best dressed captain in the Caribbean.",
"I see. And what is the best dressed captain doing in this jail?",
"I'm the lover of Camille Leone. I was captured with her by Santos.",
"Well, it's the first time I meet a couple in a prison. How did Santos capture you?",
"Camille and I left Europe because my father didn't want us to marry. When Santos discovered she was in the archipelago, he captured us...",
"for a little bit of leverage with Vito. Anyway, Santos is dead now, Vito will no doubt want to see you and Camille. I'm leaving right now."
