"What are you doing here?",
"You are Tello, right?",
"Yes. But you did not answer my question.",
"Like you, I work for Benavides and he wants you to help me.",
"What's going on that the Vice-Admiral wants my help? Anything important?",
"Maybe. He thinks the French are helping #sisland_Conceicao#. Did you note the arrival of some military or supply ships from France recently?",
"Last week, yes. A warship and a lineship...",
"Interesting. They were together?",
"Yes. But they only stayed three days in #sMarigot#. Just to resupply and then they left the island.",
"What was their destination?",
"The warship was headed for #sPort au Prince# and the lineship was to sail to #sFalaise de Fleur#.",
"Hummm... not the same destination. Anyway #sFalaise de Fleur# is closer to #sConceicao# than #sPort au Prince#. Maybe, I should investigate the lineship. Could you give me some information about that ship?",
"If I recall correctly, she's the 'La Fougueuse' and has 56 cannons and about 650 crewmembers. Captain Aurelien Bergerat commands this ship.",
"A ship of formidable strength.. Have you got any information you'd like to add? As docker maybe you worked on this ship during her call.",
"Unfortunately no. Nobody from #sMarigot# was permitted on either ship.This is very unusual. The only thing I can say is the captains of those ships were in a hurry to continue their voyage.",
"Thanks, you helped enough. Your information could be useful. Goodbye!",
