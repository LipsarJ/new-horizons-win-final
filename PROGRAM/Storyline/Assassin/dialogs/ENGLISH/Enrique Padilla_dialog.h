"Don't move Senor!",
"He tried to steal my goods! I've just defended myself.",
"I'm not here to determine who was right or wrong. I see you killed a man and there are contraband goods on the shore. I don't need to be a genius to know you are a smuggler. So I've got enough evidence to arrest you and your crew.", 
"Are you happy in your cell?",
"*ironic tone* Of course, I've been rotting for three days without knowing if I will spend the rest of my life here.",
"You are going to follow me. Someone wants to see you.",
"Who? and where are you taking me, I have a right to know?",
"You'll know it all soon enough.",
"You are in the Vice-Admiral's residence. It's an honour to talk to him, speak and act with respect or else I will break your legs. Is that clear!",
"[THINKS: Nice Guy!] Perfectly.",
"Their ship must be near the village.",
"I suppose she's moored in Playa de Sabana, it's the nearest shore.",
"I think so. Let's go there...",
"Their ship seems to leave the island.",
"Yes, they didn't think we could be so quick in our counter-attack.",
"Let's return to Havana and see Vice-Admiral Benavides. He will send some galleons here to make sure this area is safe.",
"Ha! Captain, I've just given the instructions to the Indian chief.",
"What will the Indians do?",
"When the Dutch soldiers leave the town to fight us, they will attack them by the rear. The Dutch surrounded will have no chance of winning the battle.",
"And where are the civilians?",
"The civilians? What do you mean?",
"There are civilians in the town not only soldiers. Did you let them leave the town before starting the battle?",
"Do you think I have time for secondary preoccupations?",
"What?! You let the civilians inside?! But they will be slaughtered by our cannons!",
"That's the war, Captain! Don't you know what's a war?",
"Even in a war, we must respect some rules, Captain Padilla!",
"Don't tell me what I have to do. I'm the chief of this mission! Stay here and don't mess up the battle.",
"[THINKS: Bastard!]......",
"What?",
"Are your soldiers crazy?! They have just killed a civilian.",
"You again with your moaning? He was the last one. Now, the town is 'clean'.",
"These are war crimes! I'll inform Vice-Admiral Benavides of your behaviour.",
"Do you think, because your are his most valuable mercenary, he will listen to your protests?",
"I'm sure he doesn't accept war crimes in his army.",
"Think what you want, Captain Elting. Your presence is useless in Aruba, you can return to Cuba. I'm going to stay here with my troops over the next weeks. I must strengthen our position to avoid a Dutch counter-attack.",
"As you like, I've already seen enough.",
"Captain Elting? What are you doing here ? Can you explain who are these people accompanying you?",
"Let me tell you : this is Bartolomeu o Portugues and the woman is Roxanne Lalliere.",
"What are they doing free in the jungle ? Bartolomeu should have been in a jail like Roxanne!",
"That's life. There has been a small change in the plan. Now, I'm with them.",
"I knew we couldn't count on a Dutchman to be loyal. All traitors!",
"*ironic tone* Don't be so nasty. I suppose you won't let us going to Alice town.",
"*ironic tone* Must I answer you?",
"I don't think so. Let our weapons do that instead.",
"Captain Elting! What the hell happened in the fort? The Governor of Puerto la Cruz told me you were here but not there would also be a bunch of soldiers killed.",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues is the person who killed them. When I arrived at the fort, he was about to release Roxanne Lalliere.",
"Is it him? this body?",
"Yes, I've just killed him.",
"Well, it seems you did a great work, Captain Elting. Vice-Admiral Benavides will know to reward you.",
"What do we do now?",
"We must leave the fort right now. We don't know if more pirates could come to release once more this pirate woman. My men are waiting outside, let's return to Puerto la Cruz.",
"I've just informed the Governor we leave the island.",
"We go to Havana?",
"Yes, Captain Lalliere is already aboard like the Bartolomeu's corpse. Let's go immediately!",
"Captain Elting, I've just been informed Vice-Admiral Benavides is waiting for you in the Townhall. It seems he's got some good news for you.",
"I go there, right now.",
