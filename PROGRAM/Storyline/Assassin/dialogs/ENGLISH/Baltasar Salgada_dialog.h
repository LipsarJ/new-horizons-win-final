"You are Johan Elting, I presume?",
"Right. And I suppose, you are Baltasar Salgada.",
"As you said. Did you bring the ale as planned?",
"I did. Let's unload it, I don't want to stay here for long, it is very risky.",
"Alright, the ale is loaded on the wagons, we can depart.",
"Now we need to talk about the money. You owe me 33000 gold coins for these goods.",
"Well.. I can't pay right now. I've had some troubles lately, so I'll pay you in a few months.",
"What?! They were not the terms of this deal! You were to pay me when the ale is delivered.",
"I know, but I can't do it any other way.",
"I'm sorry for you, but I cannot give you this on credit, I will lose my ship, I'm going to reload the ale and sell it elswhere.",
"NO! I need the ale to pay my debts! Don't touch it!",
"Listen to me! I have told you, you pay me what you owe me or give me back the ale. Else I will take it back by force.",
"Go to hell Dutchman, you are the son of a pig!",
"A pig eh, I'll put you on a spit, and get my ale!",
"No, I don't have the right quantity. But, we can make the deal, can't we?",
"Of course NOT! Don't count on me to work with you anymore. Goodbye!",
"Wait!", 
};
