"Hello, poppet!",
"You're a mercenary, aren't you? You speak Spanish with a foreign accent.",
"I'm Dutch, Captain Lalliere.",
"I must confess you seem to have prepared a plan in details to capture me.",
"Finally, I meet an adversary who admits my abilities.",
"I didn't think I was an important threat for the Spaniards.",
"Of course, your expedition in Santiago was not appreciated by the Spanish authorities. Even if, this wasn't the main reason of your arrest.",
"What do you mean?",
"You'll know better in Havana when you see Emilio Soares.",
"Emilio? The officer of Bartolomeu?!",
"Right. Well, I have more to do so enjoy your stay in this jail.",
"You took your sweet time. I was getting worried.",
"We’ve done it as quickly as possible. Now, we have to leave Cuba. Havana must be mobbed by soldiers after what we did there.",
"What did you do, assassin! You killed my best friend.",
"I did what I had to do. Pirate's life is not a solution for me... And for you because your end will come soon.",
"Blasted is the day, your mother gave you birth!",
"(You hear opening the prison's door) Shut up! Someone is coming. I hope it isn't another friend of yours.",
