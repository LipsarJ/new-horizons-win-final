"What is it?",
"We’re looking for someone who knows Charles Baxter.",
"Why?",
"We know Bartolomeu o Portugues arrested Baxter last year and we need to find this Portuguese pirate.",
"Are you friends of that scoundrel? If yes, you should leave this place right now.",
"No, on the contrary. We want to arrest him. Can you help us?",
"Maybe. In fact, I was an older crew member of Charles when it happened.",
"You were in this island?",
"Yes, in Charlestown when Bartolomeu captured Charles.",
"How did it happen?",
"I was aboard Charles' ship when the Bartolomeu’s crew attacked us by surprise. We’ve had to abandon the ship.", 
"The ship was in the Charlestown port?",
"Yes. Why do you ask?",
"Charlestown is not a pirate town. How did the authorities let you moor there?",
"Charles had corrupted the English governor to ‘shut the eyes’ and be protected by the authorities. He had many enemies in the pirate community so he preferred to avoid the pirate settlements in that time.",
"This didn’t prevent Bartolomeu to arrest him...",
"Indeed, I knew this scum of Bartolomeu took him to #sisland_Conceicao#.",
"#sisland_Conceicao#? Why there?",
"In fact, Bartolomeu worked for the Portuguese governor of that island. He had the mission of delivering Charles to the authorities. In the past, Charles had attacked many ships off #sisland_Conceicao#. That’s why, the governor wanted Charles.",
"I understand.",
"I’ve heard Charles was hanged soon after... But, a legend affirms Charles appears off the island, from time to time, steering a cursed caravel and attacking the ships.",
"Another legend of pirates... The most important is I know he worked for the governor of #sisland_Conceicao# and maybe he still works for him. Thanks for the information but we must go quickly.",
"I hope you'll find him. This confounded pirate has wrecked my life. After his arrest, I've never worked again for a captain with the abilities of Charles.",
"I understand. Goodbye!",
