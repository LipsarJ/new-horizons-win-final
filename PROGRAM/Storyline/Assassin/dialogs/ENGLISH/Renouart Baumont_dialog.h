"Renouart Baumont?",
"Right. Who are you?",
"I'm Captain Elting. I know you worked for Roche Brasiliano.",
"As you said, I 'worked' for the swine, Roche. Now, if you are a friend of his, I bid you goodbye.",
"Wait, you've got it all wrong, I am not a friend of his, I am tracking hm down for the Authorities, I need to know where I could find him.",
"OK, but I have no idea, Captain. He moves regularly between #sTortuga#, #sRedmond#, #sisland_Cayman# or many other places. The only thing I'm sure is that he's not on #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Maybe there is a place that he visits more often than the others?",
"You could try #sCharlestown#.",
"Why there?",
"Let's say, he had a special like for a woman working in the brothel. She may be able to help you.",
"I see, a good starting point.. Do you remember her name?",
"Her name is Lady Gaga. Anyway, I don't know if she still lives there but it's worth a try.",
"Thank you, I'll check that.",
"I hope this will be the last time I ever hear his name and he gets what's coming to him.",
"If I find him, I am sure the only thing you will hear is how he died. Thanks and Goodbye!",
