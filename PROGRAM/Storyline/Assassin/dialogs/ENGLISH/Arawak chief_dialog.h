"What do you want, Stranger?",
"You are the chief of this camp?",
"Yes, I am.",
"I have a deal for you.",
"What kind of deal?",
"A juicy deal. You can earn a lot of gold if you help me.",
"You, white man, you are only interested in gold but the Arawaks aren’t interested in greed.",
"And freedom, are you interested?",
"What do you mean?",
"I know the relationship with the Dutch isn’t really good.",
"How that could be in another way with people stealing our land.", 
"I work for a powerful nation that could give you more rights.",
"If I understand, you are the representative of a nation needing our help.",
"Exactly.",
"What are those rights we could have?",
"If you help us to evict the Dutch from Aruba, you’ll never be oppressed as you are now.",
"What? You want we fight the Dutch?! And if your nation doesn’t win the battle, you perfectly know the Dutch will kill all the Arawaks of the island as punishment.",
"If you don’t help me, the Arawaks will die anyway due to the Dutch colonization... slowly but they die.",
"I don’t know why you want to fight the Dutch in Aruba, but for me it’s a war between white men that the Arawaks don’t have any interest in participating.",
"Alright, I can’t convince you. I won’t insist...",
"However, I can help you if you want.",
"How?",
"There is a tribe in the mountains that could accept to fight for you. At least, they like gold.",
"Interesting.",
"They are not Arawaks. They belong to another ethnic group.",
"I’ll go there. Tell me exactly where I can find them.",
