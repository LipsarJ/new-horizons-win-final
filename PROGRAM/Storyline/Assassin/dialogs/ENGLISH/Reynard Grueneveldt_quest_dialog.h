"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",

"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"What are your orders, #saddr#?",
"I must manage this colony.",
"Do you know about some hostilities on near waters, #saddr#?",
"There are things I have to do.",
"Captain Elting, I hope you have a good explanation for what you did against the Dutch lately. Why did you work for the Spaniards? Our most dangerous enemy!",
"I was forced to work for them, Excellency. Otherwise, they would have hanged me.",
"It's a bit easy like excuse. From what I know, you worked for them during a long time. Try something else!",
"You're right, Governor. I could have deserted sooner. I thought about that these last days. I suppose the life of mercenary was more exciting than the one before... At least, until the Oranjestad' siege.",
"Indeed, Oranjestad! How could you fight your own compatriots? Are you still Dutch?",
"I thought the garrison would have surrended before the fight...",
"The Spaniards were no mercy. They killed everyone!",
"I protested against the death of the civilians.",
"This didn't avoid their deaths.",
"I know, Excellency. But, I avenged them...",
"What do you mean?",
"I killed the leaders of this operation, Captain Padilla and his superior : Vice-Admiral Benavides.",
"I didn't know. Humm... Why did you come here? Asking for a forgiveness?",
"Yes, Governor. I want to start a new life and forget forever my Spanish past.",
"You are asking me a lot, Captain. Your participation in the Oranjestad' siege is too serious. However, if I have the confirmation you really killed the leaders of that operation, I could reconsider my opinion about you. In the meantime, you'll stay in jail.",
"In jail?",
"Yes, Captain. I don't trust you at the moment. Guards! take him to the prison!",
"....",
"You're lucky, Captain! An informer of Havana came sooner than expected bringing some news of that Spanish town. He confirmed you really killed Captain Padilla and Vice-Admiral Benavides. It seems you left the Spanish service.",
"Of course. I told the truth in our last talk.",
"I took my decision : you are now a free man. You can live in my town if you want.",
"Thank you, Governor. I knew you were fair.",
"What do you think of doing now?",
"I want to continue fighting the Spaniards. But, I need a real ship... Not a boat for that.",
"What do you mean, Captain?",
"I bet that ship is 'El Diablo'?",
"'El Diablo'?",
"Yes, my former ship when I was working for the Spaniards. They are the only ones building this kind of Xebec.",
"Maybe, they came to spy. #sisland_Douwesen# could be their next target after Oranjestad...",
"Yes... Or they are looking for me in order to kill me after what I did in Havana.",
"That could be a possibility. We need to know their intentions before any military operation.",
"Any can be their intentions, they will send first a spy in the town to obtain the wanted information.",
"I think so. I should let my soldiers find and arrest that spy when he's in town. We could question him.",
"If you do this, they could be warned and leave the island before capturing their ship... And I'd like to recover my former ship.",
"What do you suggest like alternative?",
"Let one of your men find and contact the spy in this town. In case he's looking for me, he must tell I'm here and work for you as captain of the Dutch army and tomorrow I'll patrol with some soldiers the jungle.",
"Your idea is to ambush them?",
"Indeed. Afterwards, capturing their ship will be a formality.",
"Alright, stay in the fort until we give the wrong information to the spy. I will inform you when done.",
"Captain! My agent already passed the wrong information on to their spy yesterday.",
"The spy was looking for me?",
"Indeed, time has come to join my soldiers. The enemy must be at Crab Cliffs waiting for you.",
"So the fight will take place there... How many men will accompany me?",
"With you just a few, they are outside. But many more will follow you away. When the Spaniards attack you, my soldiers will fight them by the back.",
"Good, I go and meet them right now.",
"Congratulations! Captain de Voor told you captured your former ship.",
"Yes, Governor. After the fight at Crab Cliffs, I've just had to kill the captain aboard the ship.",
"Who was this captain?",
"[THINKS: Let's lie!] I didn't know him. Certainly a new mercenary hired by the Governor of Havana.",
"I understand. Well, I think now you recovered the ship you want to leave the island and hunt the Spaniards.",
"Indeed. I'm going to weigh anchor today.",
"As you like, Captain. I wish you good luck for your next expeditions.",
"Thank you. Goodbye Governor!",
"As you like, Captain. And now that I know I can trust you, let me give you this Letter of Marque to legalize your actions on my behalf. I wish you good luck for your next expeditions.",
