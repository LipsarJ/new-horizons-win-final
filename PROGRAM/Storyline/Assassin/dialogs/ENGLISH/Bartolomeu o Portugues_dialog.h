"(Bartolomeu talking to Roxanne) A too long story to tell you now. We must quickly leave the fort...",
"Not so quickly, my friend..",
"Of course, it was too easy, I should have realized the trap... Johan Elting, I suppose.",
"You’re right, Captain Portugues. When I saw the bodies outside, I guessed you were here. Friendship has some good aspects. Roxanne was the bait, you the fish...",
"And you, the fisherman..",
"Right again. Drop your weapons, there are enough corpses, we don't need to add another one.",
"Exactly what I was going to tell you.",
"You don’t want to calm this situation?",
"On the contrary. I make you a counter offer - a chance to leave the Spanish servitude and become a free man.. Not a slave in the hands of your Vice-Admiral.",
"Thanks to him I escaped the gallows.",
"What? Who do you think set up that phoney smuggling run, the one that was too good to be true, that landed you in jail in the first place. It was the Vice-Admiral, his way of recruiting spies. If you continue working for him you’ll die sooner rather than later.",
"That’s only your opinion. I have done well in his employ. A great ship and fine rewards for deeds done.",
"How long before you can enjoy your rewards? It must make you happy to kill your own compatriots, Judas!",
"Watch your mouth, I don’t like your sense of humour.",
"I bet the Spaniards were implacable during the Oranjestad’ siege. You were there, weren’t you?",
"Yes. And I protested against the behaviour of some soldiers.",
"I guess the Spaniards didn’t hear you.",
"Your silence is a confirmation. I only see two options. Firstly, you stay in the Spanish service and we will fight now or, you decide to desert and be my partner and a free man.",
"Your argument is futile, Captain. In a few years I will be free and rich. If I leave now, I'll have the rest of the Spanish mercenaries on my tail, and won't live to be free. I have no choice but to kill you. En garde!",
"Well... I need to think a bit.",
"Yes, think again Captain Elting. I will help protect you if you desert the Spaniards. How many Dutch will you kill before you realize your mistake?",
"I don’t know... I don’t know what’s good or what’s bad anymore... I’m just trying to stay alive, to tell the truth...",
"I promise I'll help you.",
"A promise of pirate.",
"But more valid than the ones of your Vice-Admiral. Ask to my men if I abandoned them when they were about to be hung in Havana.",
"Alright... I hope I won’t regret my decision. I come with you but don't betray me. Otherwise...",
"Thank you Captain Elting. You've made the right decision.",
"What’s our plan now, Captain Portugues?",
"My plan? For now, we need to go to Alice Town so that Roxanne and I can join our crews. Let’s go!",
"Stop, I need to tell you that Enrique Padilla has come here.",
"Who?",
"This officer works for Vice-Admiral Benavides. He’s his right hand, the enforcer, he does the dirty work whilst keeping the Vice-Admiral's hands clean.",
"I see... we have a little work now and proof of your changed loyalty.",
"Happy to see this scum of a night pan, Padilla, dead. I’ve never could like him, low life worse than any pirate, no offence meant.",
"None taken, I guessed it was so. Well, let’s go to Alice Town.",
"Can we leave the island now?",
"Yes, but I need to free Emilio Soares. Where is he?",
"In the jail at Havana.",
"So, we’ll go there. I let you sail my ship up to Cuba and Captain Lalliere will accompany us.",
"Good decision, Captain. Otherwise, can we go? We are on their most wanted list, we need to be careful?",
"Yes, we’ll free Emilio tonight.",
"Not easy to climb the walls.",
"We couldn’t enter by the door at this hour. It would arouse the suspicion of the guards and they would look too closely at us.",
"Why did you hide your weapons?",
"In order to enter the prison. Tell to the guard who you are and that you arrested me. Like this, we'll be able to enter the jail without fighting all the guards.",
"Done! I killed the last one. Let’s join Roxanne.",
"Wait a bit, Captain. I have to sort somebody out, or I will never feel like a free man.",
"What do you mean?",
"Before leaving Havana, I want to kill the person who has made my life hell.",
"Vice-Admiral Benavides?",
"Yes. He has to pay for his wrongdoings, lies and deception.",
"I understand, but is it necessary to do it now, we have just tried our luck once, we may not be as lucky again?",
"You don’t need to be with me. I will join you later.",
"No, I prefer to help you. We are partners, aren’t we?",
"Don’t worry, I already have a plan.",
"What is it ?",
"To avoid the guards, I’ll place a fougasse, a kind of mine, at the back of the Benavides’ residence door. When he opens it, the bomb will explode.",
"How do you think you can get inside the house?",
"Only by the roof, the residence is guarded day and night.",
"When will you place the bomb?",
"Soon, in the morning, his first task is always to meet the Governor at the townhall. I’ll take advantage of his absence to install the bomb. When he comes back to the residence... BOOM!",
"Good. I’ll wait for you near the residence just in case you have a problem. In the meantime, Emilio will go and see Roxanne at Bahia de San Antonio and tell her we’ll arrive later in the morning.",
"Done!",
"Finally, you're back. I thought you must have had a problem.",
"No, everything is alright. Benavides should arrive soon.",
"Let’s watch the entrance.",
"Captain, I thought about my future during the voyage and I think I should leave you.",
"What?! I wanted to hire you as my officer.",
"Thank you for your kind offer, but I want to live back with my compatriots again. #sdouwesen# is my destination. I'll beg for a pardon from our Dutch Governor.",
"Well, if it's your will... How will you get there?",
"I've just bought a small ship to a fisherman before you disembarked.",
"As you like, my friend, Captain Elting. Be sure, I'll always help you in the future if and when you want me, you have only to ask.",
"Thank you. You have already helped so much by showing me the right course for a better future. Goodbye!",
"Fare thee well, may the winds be at your back, gold in your purse and rum always in your hold!",
"Alright, Captain.",
"Do you know him?",
"They won't bother us anymore.",
"What?",
"Captain Lalliere will stay here protecting the ships during the operation. I've already had to fight a company of soldiers the last time I was in this shore.",
"Done!",
"Understood.",
"You're right.",
"Any preference where to?",
"Let’s go to #sRedmond#. We’ll decide there what's next, we just have to get to a safe harbour.",
"At last, at #sRedmond#.",
"Captain Elting?! I didn't see you for a while.",
"Indeed. I'm here for you, Captain.",
"What do you mean?",
"Like you, I work for Henry Morgan and he wants to know why you are not in #sRedmond#.",
"So, we are partners again. Pleased to know that. About the delay, I've had two problems.",
"What exactly? Anything about the treasure?",
"Yes, it only arrived at Vera Cruz a few days ago. It should have been here for almost two months according to the informer I pay.",
"Do you know why it was long to come?",
"No idea. My informer couldn't give me the reason. The other problem is the Silver Fleet is already here.",
"Yes, I saw her. From now on, Morgan can't attack the town.",
"Right...",
"So, what's your plan now?",
"I need to confirm the treasure is in Vera Cruz.",
"But, you've just told the treasure was here. Don't you trust your informer?!",
"Not fully, he could make up the information only for earning more money. Anyway, I want to be sure the treasure really exists and it isn't a legend.",
"How can you confirm this?",
"*Humorous tone* With my eyes, of course... Or I should say with my single eye.",
"Are you fine? The treasure must be guarded and not by a few soldiers.",
"Indeed. It's in the fort with a company of soldiers.",
"The fort is the building in front of the tavern?",
"Yes. I think you also saw the door? Unfortunately, the treasure would have got into the fort by a second door looking outside, towards a road through the jungle.",
"How can you reach the treasure?",
"I will penetrate into the fort at night climbing the walls.",
"Very dangerous...",
"My informer thinks it must be in the main warehouse. I just need one or two minutes to know what contains the treasure.",
"Would you like I be with you?",
"No, for this kind of mission, it's preferable to be alone so as not to be detected. But, you could wait for me outside the fort.",
"Near this tavern for instance?",
"Yes. if a patrol arrives I want you help me to run away.",
"I hope you know what you do.",
"By the way, did you let your ship in the port?",
"Yes. Why?",
"Not good. With the help of Emilio, move her near my ship before starting the operation. Otherwise, you could be arrested before leaving the port if the guards unmask us.",
"I'll do it.",
"No time for talking! Follow me!!",
"We are safe now!",
"Can you tell me why you jumped from the wall? I thought you were going to die.",
"When I was coming back to the wall, a guard saw me and raised the alarm. I couldn't climb down; I had no time for that.",
"Fortunately, there was a tent to slow down your fall.",
"Thanks to it, I didn't break my legs.",
"You saw the treasure?",
"Just a part, but I was impressed. I saw many objects in emerald and gold without forgetting a throne made in precious stones. Only this must be worth a fortune!",
"As Morgan told, it's the treasure of a king.",
"I think so. With my part of loot, I could return rich to my country.",
"Me too. We really need to steal the treasure.",
"Of course, we need. However, it won't happen in Vera Cruz.",
"Should we return to #sRedmond#?",
"Not at the moment. We must know where the Silver Fleet goes.",
"Do you think the fleet will directly go to Spain?",
"Not sure. She often calls in at Havana before leaving the Caribbean.",
"We should follow the fleet to know her destination.",
"Right. We'll wait here until the fleet leaves Vera Cruz. She just ought to stay a few days.",
"Alright, Captain.",
"Dash it! Due to the tempest, we lost the fleet's trail...",
"And one day to repair our ships.",
"Now, we can only hope the fleet really goes to Havana. Otherwise, goodbye treasure!",
"Let's go to Cuba right now!",
"(Bartolomeu to Morgan) Fortunately, she went to Havana before heading for Spain.",
"(Morgan to Bartolomeu) God! I prefer not to think if she would have left the Caribbean first.",
"I asked you to come in my cabin because we can't go to Havana with our clothes. Havana must be the most dangerous town of the Caribbean after what we did there.",
"What's your idea?",
"In the past, I entered Santo Domingo dressed in priest.",
"Priest?!",
"Yes, their robes allow to hide the face. We won't be recognized by the guards. I kept them after the operation and they are still here.",
"Well, let's wear them.",
"We are ready. However, I don't still know how to get the information Morgan wants.",
"Maybe, I've got a solution. I know someone working for the Spanish as I had to.",
"A mercenary?",
"No, a former pirate captain called Damski. To avoid the gallows, he must work as shipwright.",
"Do you think he knows where the Aztec treasure is?",
"No idea but we should try. It's better than nothing.",
"Agreed. Let's go and see him.",
"The most obvious would be to ask the captain of this fleet.",
"For that, we must kidnap him. Too dangerous.",
"I think we could still use our robes.",
"What do you mean?",
"When he comes back to the port, he will have to pass near the Church. You could shout at him telling the priest of Havana wants to speak with him.",
"You're right. However, how to recognize him?",
"Before you entered the Church I found another robe here. Let's dress him so that we can take him to the Morgan' ship.",
"And his guards?",
"Dead! I hid them in the presbytery.",
"In a few minutes, all the crew will be with us. We'll be able to attack.",
"Yes. But, we need Morgan and his troops attract the guards' attention before. Let's wait.",
"Yes?",
"What's Morgan doing? He would have had to attack the main entry at this hour so that we infiltrate the fort.",
"Would you like I go and see what happens in front of the fort?",
"Yes, I would. There must be a reason for this delay.",
"Dash it! The Spanish have put a camp up.",
"What?! Don't tell me they knew we were going to attack.",
"I don't think so. I discreetly approached some guards and heard their conversation. They belong to the Silver Fleet. I've got the idea the authorities prefer to let some of the Fleet' soldiers rest on land during the stay.",
"Not good. Morgan didn't expect this additional force.",
"The biggest problem are the cannons protecting the camp. If Morgan attacks, most of his men will die before reaching the fort.",
"We must help them.",
"How?",
"Destroying the cannons.",
"We are few to attack them.",
"No, you and the crew will stay here and wait for my order before acting. I'll go alone and sabotage these cannons. Afterwards, I'll inform Morgan the way is free.",
"Here you are! Did you succeed?",
"Yes. Morgan and his men are attacking the main entrance. What are you doing with your men?",
"I decided to send these men to the top of the fort thanks to a grapnel. They could be useful to locate the enemy when we start the operation.",
"Good! Let's join our crew on the rear.",
"Let's go! The way is free.",
"We should use the tower on my left to go to the top of the fort.",
"You're right, Captain. Let's move quickly!",
"The Spanish captured my men.",
"What?",
"Those two men I sent like scout were arrested by the soldiers. I saw them hidden from the low wall on the other side.",
"How many soldiers are there?",
"Five near my men. But, there is a soldier guarding the access to them.",
"What do you think we should do?",
"The soldier could alert these comrades and put in danger my men. I'll discreetly kill him and only after we'll be able to ambush the other ones.", 
"Alright. Go ahead, I follow you.",
"Now, it's my turn to follow you.",
"Fair.",
"Damn it! It seems Morgan is downstairs fighting the guards.",
"Let's check that.",
"It seems a party began without us.",
"No need of guest cards for this kind of party.",
"Well, everything is settled for now.",
"Fortunately... Seeing Captain Morgan doesn't have any plans, have you got a new expedition in mind?",
"None. As Morgan, I'll rest a few weeks but not here. I prefer #sTortuga# for that. Afterwards, I'll see what will be my plans.",
"Alright, I'll go to #sDouwesen#. If you need my help for a new expedition, you can find me there.",
"Thanks, I'll remember. See you!",
"Goodbye, Captain!",
