"Captain Elting?!",
"Are you not happy of seeing your former sergeant?",
"Not undisciplined former soldiers.",
"In your opinion, I was undisciplined. In my opinion, I was only criticizing your deplorable orders. I've never understood how someone so incompetent had reached a rank of Captain in the Dutch Army.",
"Don't think because you aren't under my orders from now on, you can insult me!",
"You're right, don't let our personal divergences disturb my mission.", 
"Your mission? What do you mean?",
"You are under arrest!",
"What?! Ha-Ha!! Alright, you are crazy. I would have had to guess it. Clear the way and don't waste my time!",
"I'm not joking, don't force me to use my blade.",
"That's enough! You deserve a lesson.",
"En garde!",
"Alright, alright... Don't kill me! What do you want exactly?",
"That's better. Follow me to my ship, I'll explain you.",
"And now?",
"I'll take you to Havana, tomorrow.",
"What?! Havana?",
"Yes, Vice-Admiral Benavides wants to know the defences of #sisland_Douwesen# in details for a future landing and for capturing #sDouwesen# of course.",
"So, it was true when people told you worked for the Spaniards.",
"That's life, Captain.",
"Scum of mercenary!",
"Be careful with your tongue, Captain. Your voyage could be very painful otherwise. My officer will take you to the hold, you'll keep the rats company ha! ha!",
"Captain Elting?! How do you dare to come here? This time, you won't escape me. You are under arrest, traitor!",
"*Humoristic tone* Well done, Captain de Voor. Once more, thanks to your cleverness, you found me. And I must say it was not easy; a man disembarking in the only port of this island. I'm impressed...",
"You like taking me for a ride, don't you? We'll see if you continue showing off in presence of the Governor. The fate of a traitor like you is the gallows, if you don't know.",
"Meeting the Governor is what I wanted to do by the way.",
"(Berend to the Governor) Excellency, I was patrolling when I saw a non-identified ship at Palm Beach.",
"(Governor to Berend) Maybe a ship belonging to the smugglers.",
"No, Governor. That's the problem. It's a warship not a merchant ship.",
"(You to Berend) A warship there? I suppose it's an enemy ship otherwise she would have moored here, in the port.",
"I think so even if she had no flag hoisted.",
"What kind of warship is she?",
"A Xebec but very well equipped. She's got a lot of cannons. I must say it was the first time I saw a Xebec like that.",
"That's her!",
"We gave them a good leason!",
"I think we killed most of their crew. It can't have a lot of people in their ship.",
"I think so. We should attack the ship right now.",
"Indeed. Let's go to Palm beach!",
"The ship is still here. Let's go!",
"I would prefer you stay on the beach.",
"Why? It must be dangerous boarding the ship alone.",
"I can deal with the few men remaining on the ship. Moreover, we don't know if there are another crewmembers in the jungle that could return to the ship. You should protect the shore while I board her.",
"As you like. But, if you take too much time for capturing the ship I will join you.", 
"Alright. My priority is to find and kill their Captain. I'll be quick.",
