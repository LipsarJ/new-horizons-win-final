"My captain won't appreciate what you did.",
"Where is your captain?",
"Why are you so interested in seeing him?",
"Your Captain likes annoying the Spanish authorities. Time has come to pay for that.",
"You are losing your time. You are not the first one wanting to arrest him...",
"I guess it. That's why I'm in charge of this work.",
"*Humorous tone* You mean the Spaniards sent their best warrior to capture my captain. At least, you are modest...",
"No, pragmatic. So, where is he?",
"I won't tell you.",
"Don't you fear the death?",
"If you want to kill me, do it because I won't tell anything.",
"Alright. If you don't want to help me in this way you'll help me in another one.",
"Havana... What's my fate? The gallows?",
"Not yet. At least until I arrest Bartolomeu.",
"You?! You also arrested my Captain? One day you'll pay for that!",
"Chuuuutttt... Talk softly. I'm getting you out of this rotten prison.",
"What are you talking?! Are you joking, now?",
"No, I decided to join your side. Bartolomeu is not arrested but here for freeing you.",
"Captain?!, you here!",
"Hello, Emilio. Good to see you. I thought you weren't in this town. I didn't see the Bartolomeu' ship in the port.",
"To avoid any trouble with the Spanish authorities, Bartolomeu moored her in a deserted beach near the town. Otherwise, what are you doing here?",
"It isn't by chance I'm here. Captain Morgan sent me to know why Bartolomeu doesn't come back to #sRedmond#.",
"We've had some unexpected incidents. But, you should talk to Bartolomeu. He's in the tavern.",
"Alright. I follow you.",
