"You called me?",
"Yes, I heard the crew recently discussed my decisions.",
"Indeed, it was about the Aztec throne.",
"I wouldn't have taken the right decision of letting the governor sells the throne.",
"You made a mistake, Captain. We can't trust the Governor, he could keep the throne for him.",
"The Governor is not a pathetic thief. He gave me his word as he did for Morgan and Elting.",
"He wouldn't be the first Governor to deceive privateers...",
"And what was the other option? Cut my part of the throne in hundreds smaller parts to give a piece for each crewmember. That's ridiculous!",
"At least, we would have something in our pockets.",
"Don't make me laugh! I noted your game. You try to rise up the crew against me. If you are not happy with my leadership look for another captain.",
"Or maybe you should look for another crew and ship.",
"Don't provoke me! I put up with you in the past but my patience is limited. Tomorrow, I'll give you your part of gold and you'll leave the ship. Maybe, you'll find in #sTortuga# a captain crazy enough to hire you.",
"As you like. I hope you know what you do.",
"Well, well, well... I hope you don't bear me a grudge to wake you up. You arrived at destination.",
"Traitor! You even hadn't the courage to fight me in a duel. You stunned me when I was sleeping.",
"Sorry, but I'm pirate not gentleman. Time has come for the crew to have a real captain that knows how to defend their interests instead of those of a Governor.",
"I see you're good to manipulate the mind of the crew. They are with you...",
"Yes, except your favourite officer, Emilio.",
"Where is he?",
"Locked in his room. I'll see later what I'll do with him.",
"What's your plan now?",
"I found a special spot that you'll allow to command a crew of crabs. I'm sure they will accept you as their new captain HAHAHA!",
"Look at me carefully because next time I won't let you enough time for talking to me.",
"You like dreaming, don't you? Have a nice stay.",
