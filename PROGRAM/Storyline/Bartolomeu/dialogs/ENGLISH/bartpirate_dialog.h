"Is there a problem, sir?",
"No. Never mind.",
"Thank you, Captain! We didn't recognize your new friend, but we knew we'd be free as soon as we saw you here. What a relief, we thought that we were on the way to meet our maker!",
"Thank William. I wouldn't even be here if he hadn't agreed to help rescue you.",
"I think we're safe now.",
"Right! So what happened to Emilio, where is he?",
"He escaped into the jungle on the way to jail.",
"I see. Do you know where he went?",
"He told me he had to get to #sSantiago#, find a ship and escape #sisland_Cuba#.",
"Thanks Javier for the information.",
"Captain! How did you get here? So it is true. You really escaped from this ship and you're alive, and the guards told us that they killed and tossed you overboard - lying bastards!",
"Yes, my friends. I was happy to get away, but I couldn't bear to leave you rot in this hold. HA-HA! What a day! Now, prepare the ship, she is our salvation, I'm going to check if everything is still under control on the dock.",
"What are the orders captain?",
"Unload the sugar, the cinnamon and the fruits. I'm going to haggle with Eugene for a fair price for these goods.",
"Captain! We are attacked!",
"What are you talking about? Attacked here, how, there was no sail on the horizon when we moored!",
"Pirates came from the jungle and captured the 'Santiago'. We were taken by surprise and were not enough to defend the ship.",
"Dash it all! Have they left the shore yet?",
"Not yet. I escaped when they were taking our unloaded goods and re-loading them. Damn their sorry hides!",
"Let's get 'em before they can weigh anchor.",
"Stop, stop! We surrender!",
"Congratulations you low life bunch of scums, you held me up long enough for my ship to escape. Tell me who is your chief, if you want to live!",
"It's Pedro Rivera. He's already boarding the ship, he has left us for dead, the rotten son of a monkey.",
"Pedro Rivera?! That's the scum that worked for me, cost me a lot of coins and nearly got us all killed.",
"Yes, he told us and that it was pay back because you took his job when he was locked up in jail. He saw you moor the ship and he decided to ambush the few crew you had left here.",
"I should have killed that bastard after the warehouses' attack in #sisland_Cuba#. Tell me where he's going?",
"We don't know.",
"Don't take me for a ride. I have no patience or mercy left.",
"I swear! We don't have any idea. He doesn't have any other refuge outside this island. We can't tell you what we do not know, please spare us.",
"Clear off! If I see you again I'll open your throats!",
