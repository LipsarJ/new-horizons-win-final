"Nice to see you again! How are you?",
"Fine! Thanks Johan! What about you? Do you now work for the Governor of #sDouwesen#?",
"You are not a good enough captain to be in front of me. Get out if you want to live!",
"All right. I'll come back later.",
"Yes, he pardoned me. I've even succeeded in getting back the ship I had when I was working for Vice-Admiral Benavides.",
"Good news. How did you manage that?",
"My former officer, Chico Cois, he was the new captain of my old ship. His mission was to find and kill me. I found out about his plans in time and was able to ambush him and capture the ship. What are your plans, we could join forces and give em hell, they will write stories about us!",
"It is nice to have the upper hand occasionally? Tell me some more of your proposal.",
"For now, I have other fish to fry. But I am happy to see you again. Things may change in the future and we may be better off together then.",
"Well! Here are the terms! You won't have to provide goods for my crew during our association but you can look after repairs of my ship in friendly ports if you want. OK?",
"Will I have to pay salary for you and your crew?",
"No, of course not, and my crew will not require your rations at sea, but... Follow my advice! When you cease our partnership, all the plunder must be divided in two equal parts and must not be less than ",
"Calm down. Do you doubt my loyalty! Your proposition is acceptable. When do we take to sea?",
"Sorry but I think I'd prefer to make expeditions without partner!",
"As soon as possible! I want to smell the beautiful perfume of powder and blood in the morning! Ah Ah! and the touch of gold and finery ",
"Well and good, but if I need to talk to you or cease our partnership? What do I need to do?",
"We'll meet here in town. This port is good protection from our enemies. You don't need to provide Planks, Sailcloth and munitions for my ship. After each mission, we will spend few days here and my crew will resupply my ship!",
"Aye! I hope that our association will remain engraved in the memory of nations as one of the best -worst- of caribbean history!",
"Here is a good safe anchorage. If we spend a few days here, I will resupply my ship and make some repairs!",
"It would be a good thing to spend a few days here",
"We can't stay here! We have to sail away!",
"The time has come to part and go our separate ways, my friend",
"How many days will we spend here?",
"1 day will be enough",
"5 days spent in a safe place will be very good for our crew moral!",
"I changed my mind!",
"In that case, I think the time has come to divide our gold in 2 equal parts!",
"It's time Captain!",
"You know, I think I will keep all the booty for myself!",
"I changed my mind... Why do we need to separate, after all?",
". You are my brother captain and I'll be here for you, maybe you would like sail with me again someday!",
"I'll be thinking about it my friend. Hope to see you again!",
"Cutthroat! You are already dead!",
"We will see about that, engarde.",
"My old friend! What a pleasure to see you alive and well! Which good wind brings you to these waters!",
"Only a friendly visit to talk and catch up on any news!",
"I want to organise an expedition with you captain! I have a lot of enemies in these waters so your ship and your experience will be a help!",
"With the same terms as our previous expedition lad! Fifty-fifty with a booty of ",
"Of course. Don't doubt my alligence to you!",
"All things considered, it will have to be for another time. I need to think about it.",
"Ahoy my friend! Let's have a drink to our new expedition! I feel like I am rusting in this port!",
"Let's have a drink to our gold!",
"You try to trick me, my friend! Did you hide some gold from me! If that's all you have to share, I think that I'm going to keep all the booty for myself and kill you now!",
"You think you can kill me so easily, captain... Think again!",
"Every Frenchman alive in this world is my enemy and I've heard that you are a friend of the French crown! You are lucky to be ashore Lad! As long as you're accepted in french ports, we have nothing to talk about, captain!",
" Aye! One day perhaps!",
" Gold minimum, or I will cut your throat, brother!",
" For you and ",
" for me",
" gold minimum to be shared!",
