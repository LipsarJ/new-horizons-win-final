"Where do you think you are? No civilians allowed in this area at night and more so wandering in my house! Get out now before I call my guards!",
"Be silent or I swear you'll be dead in a second.",
"You're a thief, aren't you?",
"Yes but also pirate. I'm not here to steal your gold, I want some information.",
"Information?!",
"I know your Governor is looking for an indian idol. Tell me where I can find it.",
"I don't understand what you are talking about. You must be mistaken.",
"You are not very smart commander. Must I place a dagger on your throat and cut a bit for you to remember better?",
"You will end your life on a gallows.",
"In your case, you will die on this floor if you waste my time anymore. I repeat for the last time : Where's the idol?!",
".... Alright, we think it is on Curaçao.",
"Why there?",
"Ten years ago, the authorities of Puertobello discovered a temple lost in the jungle near their city. They found many inscriptions on a wall and, thanks to our scientists, translated a message confirming the existence of an indian idol guarded by a tribe called the Darien. The idol has magical powers.",
"Why did you tell me the idol is on Curaçao if the temple was around Puertobello?",
"Because the message described that during the war against the Aztecs, the Dariens sent a small part of their population with the statuette to an island so that it didn't fall into Aztec hands. The problem for us was to find which island as there was no information about its location.",
"So?",
"Two months ago, we found the Island by chance.",
"How?",
"As you know, we are at war with Holland. We thought to plan a big expedition to attack #sWillemstad#. An attack not by sea through the port but by land over the mountain range behind, they have no defences there. So, we sent some spies to the other side of #sisland_Curacao# to explore the region and find a way for our troops to attack the town from the rear.",
"And your spies found a clue about the idol!",
"Right. They found a tablet with the same writing as the Darien temple near Puertobello.",
"Really interesting. I just need to explore the area to find the idol...",
"You won't find it.",
"Why this certainty?",
"A week ago, my governor sent a battleship to bring the statuette back. So, if the snakes or the indians don't kill you, our soldiers will, or you will just be too late.",
"We'll see. If you value your health, you had better not be lying, or I'll be back.",
"I told the truth, nothing but the truth, so help me God!",
"Alright, alright, enough already. By the way, have a good night!",
"What did you do to my commander bastard!",
"Nothing compared to what I am going to do to you.",
