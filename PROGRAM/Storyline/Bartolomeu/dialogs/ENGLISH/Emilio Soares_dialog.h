"Yes? What do you want?",
"Are you Emilio Soares?",
"Indeed, who are you?",
"Your new Captain!",
"How is it possible?! I already have a Captain.",
"You mean you had a captain, the one who is in jail now and can't do his job? Forget him! He's been fired.",
"He finally went too far, he always was a source of problems.",
"It seems so. But I haven't introduced myself: Bartolomeu da Cueva but people usually call me Bartolomeu o Portugues. Your name is also Portuguese is it not?",
"Yes, but I've never been to Portugal. In fact, I came from Brazil two years ago looking for a better life.",
"I see...Well, Emilio, we can't waste anymore time here. Our Boss gave us a mission to deliver cargo to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# so let's look lively now.",
"So did you resign?",
"Yes, I would like you to continue being my officer?",
"What are you planning to do now?",
"There are plenty of opportunities to earn a lot of money in this archipelago. We have to be more ambitious if we want to be rich one day.",
"You're right and I'm fed up with this life. I accept, I will follow you.",
"Great Emilio! Let's go to the tavern to celebrate our new partnership.",
"......",
"......",
"Bartolomeu! Great jumping jellyfish, how did you find me and who's the man with you,?",
"A friend. We have rescued your crewmates at #sHavana# and one of them said you probably went to #sSantiago#.",
"True. I wanted to find a ship headed for #sisland_Redmond#, but have been unable to. #sisland_Redmond# was the place where all escaped crew would re-unite, any survivors would again be together and we could then plan to save the rest.",
"Good plan. Now follow us. We can finally leave this dangerous island.",
"Dash it! They killed the Captain!",
"That's so unfair after what he did for us! May his mercenary soul rot in hell! One day, I will kill the Governor of #sHavana#!",
"Don't get worked up Captain! We should announce the death to his crew.",
"You're right Emilio. Let's go now.", 
"Captain! Finally, I found you. Are you OK?",
"What hell! I've thought I would die, drowned.",
"Indeed, that storm was horrible...",
"Are you hurt Emilio?",
"Thanks be to God, I'm not even scratched.",
"And what about the crew? All the men are here?",
"No, unfortunately. There are some men missing. We don't know if they made another shore or if they are dead. A big problem, we lost our weapons during the shipwreck.",
"Luckily, I succeeded in keeping my weapons. Emilio, despite being on dry land, we are still not safe on this Spanish island. We need to quickly find our comrades, steal a ship so we can leave #sisland_Cuba# - if we don't want to be hung. Let's go!",
"Spanish guards! Bartolomeu! Run away!", 
"Are you crazy! I'm not going to leave you.",
"You are almost the only man armed. It's impossible to win the fight!",
"You're right. I swear I'll be back!",
"So what are we going to do?",
"Eugene lent us a ketch. But we need a bigger ship if we want to recover the #sSantiago#.",
"Where do you want to look for our new ship?",
"No need to go too far. We'll look around #sisland_IslaMuelle#. The traffic of galleons is important in this area. That would narrow our search area. Let's go Emilio, the ketch is waiting for us.",
"I have a good news.",
"What good news do you have Emilio? The Spanish captain found the stolen goods, arrested us and we've just arrived at #sSanto Domingo# and our reward is to be hung as pirates!",
"Be quiet captain! I've got a plan to escape.",
"What? How?!",
"I had a small dagger hidden in my clothes that the soldiers didn't find and confiscate.",
"Now, I understand why you spent so much time near the door.",
"Exactly. I've just succeeded in unlocking the door.",
"Excellent Emilio! I don't know what I would do without you. Let's get off this ship. We have to reach the coast.",
"Thanks to God, we are safe!",
"Indeed. We've been lucky, the guards didn't see us and we even managed to get our weapons back, right from under their noses. Ha Ha.",
"And now, what do we do?",
"I'm sick of losing ships. First the 'Santiago' and now the galleon. So we're going to recover the galleon first.",
"What? Are you sick in the head, captain? Steal a ship in the #sSanto Domingo# Port?!",
"Don't worry I'm not crazy. I cannot leave our crewmates in Spanish hands. I have a plan. But first, we need to go to the Buccaneer Camp. I have to find somebody with a ship. I know there are some fishermen living in a village near #sSanto Domingo#. Let's go there and see if we are still lucky.",
"And now?",
"Did you notice a church in the village?",
"Yes, why do you ask, I can wait a long while before I need to tell my sins?",
"Follow me, we need to talk to the priest.",
"That's done!",
"Is the priest alive, it is a bad omen to kill a priest?",
"Yes, he's tied up in the presbytery. You only knocked him out.",
"Do you think he would have helped us steal a ship right from under the noses of the authorities. I had no choice. Fortunately, he'd had enough robes for all of us.",
"Seeing that you mentioned robes, I must say I feel weird wearing one.",
"I bet death is weirder than wearing a robe. At least dressed like this, we have a chance of stealing the ship. Gentlemen, time has come to recover our galleon. Let's go.",
"First part is done.",
"Yes, now let's free the crew in the cargo hold.",
"Damn, the crew is not here.",
"They are most probably locked up in the second cargo hold.",
"We need to leave port, now, before being detected by the fort.", 
"Yes Emilio, let's get far away from this hell hole!",
"Have you seen the caravel moored in the port?",
"Yes, I've never seen a model like her before, quite different.",
"She seems to be sleaker, a faster model I bet.",
"No doubt. I'm sure she belongs to that devil pirate, Charles.",
"If this is true, he will be ashore, where could he be?",
"No idea, yet. Let us go to the shipyard and make sure that it's Charles' ship, we may find out where he lives or other information that will help us, too.",
"That man was definitly not friendly, a man in business would normally be helpful.",
"Indeed. But his mood changed only after I talked of Charles proves that Charles is really here in town.",
"We could ask the Governor about Charles.",
"Forget it! He's the last person to ask. I know the Governor is in his pocket, we would only land ourselves in jail or worse, we could even loose Charles.",
"So what are we going to do?",
"We need to continue our search. We'll find him or someone else willing to help us.",
"What?! Our mission is only to arrest him.",
"Of course. But we have two reasons to capture the ship. First, his crew will chase us and we cannot out run that ship. Secondly, she's a fine ship, and we have the chance to own it?",
"And what about his crew?",
"Most of them will be in the tavern or in the brothel, this is a safe port for them. Anyway, to be sure there will be just few men onboard the ship, I'll organize a 'show' in town.",
"What do you mean?",
"I'm going to challenge Charles to a duel.",
"That's crazy. Even if you defeat Charles, his men will kill you if you are alone.",
"Yes, I know. That's why you, after capturing the ship and at the end of the duel, will use the cannons on the town and scare his men off.",
"And the fort? Do you think they will stand by while we fire on the town?",
"You're right. I didn't think about that...",
"What are the orders captain?",
"Join the crew and prepare for the boarding. After shooting some cannonballs on the town, sail to the Pirate Settlement port. I'll meet you there with Charles dead or alive.. If I survive of course.",
"I prefer not to think of this last possibility.",
"If I die, I know you'll be a good captain for the crew. However, don't be pessimistic and go. You have no time to waste.",
"Captain, thank God! I knew you would have won the duel.",
"HA-HA! For a second I didn't think I would, they were almost on me. I didn't think you would have shot at hand, but I am here because you did.",
"Sorry Captain! But it was the only way to take away Charles' men, quickly.",
"In fact, you killed some of them with the grape shot. They were 'taken away' after a fashion, ha ha. Anyway, how did you fare during the boarding?",
"We didn't have any deaths or casualties on our side and their 'skeleton' crew will be REAL skeletons as soon as the crabs finish their work. Ha ha.",
"Great! I can't wait to be sailing our new ship.",
"Does he know what we plan to do with him?",
"No, not yet. I'll only relax when he's delivered into the hands of the Governor. Let's go, Emilio!",
"Has the Governor been generous?",
"Yes, he gave us 40 000 gold coins and a sword for me.",
"Excellent! A good outcome, by the way, the goods given to us are fully loaded.",
"What did he give us?",
"Sugar, cinnamon and fruits.",
"That sounds good! We should go to the Buccaneer Camp to sell the cargo, we will get a better price from Eugene.",
"Right. But before we go, I have a sin to confess about Pedro Rivera, he was my captain before Eugene fired him and gave you his job. I should have warned you, but didn't say anything earlier because he threatened my life back in the tavern, when you first met Roxanne.",
"That's all water under the keel now, Emilio. Pedro is probably dead and I don't doubt your loyalty to me. Make ready to sail now, I already have an idea for our next adventure, after selling the cargo, of course.",
"That's unbelievable! and it was all going so well.... now we are ruined.",
"I swear I'll find that Pedro again, I won't give him another chance. He is probably drinking our rum and laughing at us right now, the bastard. Let's go back to Eugene. Maybe, he could help us, again.",
"I don’t understand Captain. What ship are you talking about?",
"You won’t accompany me during this mission, nor will the crew. The ship stays here, by the way.",
"Why Captain?",
"Governor’s orders. Until the end of this mission, our ship will stay here.",
"I didn't expect that. How long do you expect to be away, the men will get bored and unsettled?",
"I don’t know, but I suspect a good many weeks to accomplish the mission.",
"Let’s hope nothing bad happens to you. Meanwhile, the crew will take some well earned rest, I will keep up their training and they will have time for some fun as well.",
"Don’t worry. Take care of the crew, look after the ship and stay out of trouble while I am away... Goodbye Emilio!",
"Captain?!",
"Chuuuutttt... Talk softly. I'm getting you out of this rotten prison.",
"The kind of news I like hearing.",
"Am I going with you.",
"No, go and see Roxanne right now at Bahia de San Antonio and tell her we’ll arrive later in the morning.",
"Done! Captain. The gold is in the hold.",
"Thanks, Emilio. Let's return to #sTortuga#. Governor Ogeron must be getting worried by now.",
"Now the ship is safe near Vera Cruz, what are your orders?",
"My first task is to find an informer.",
"Have you got an idea for that?",
"Maybe. We know the treasure can only be guarded in the fort. However, no soldier will accept to work for us. We would be quickly hanged instead. So, we need to know if there are civilians working in the fort. A good quantity of gold coins will motivate them to help us.", 
"Where do you think of starting the search.",
"The tavern is the easiest way.",
"Captain! The Silver Fleet has just arrived.",
"Damn it! It was not expected so early. The treasure is even not here. Let's go to the port I want to see that.",
"A big fleet, Captain.",
"Indeed. Not good for us. Even if the treasure arrives, Morgan won't be able to steal the treasure here. There are too many troops. Anyway, I bet the fleet will leave the port over the next few days.",
"What do you think of doing?",
"I'm going to wait for the treasure afterwards I'll see what I can do.",
"Captain! Agilo wants to speak with you.",
"About the treasure?",
"Yes, he's got an important news.",
"Good! Let's see him.",
"Sorry Captain but I must speak with you right now.",
"Is there a problem, Emilio? You seem worried.",
"During the voyage, the crew talked about the Aztec throne. They didn't agree you let the throne to the Governor of #sRedmond#.",
"I didn't give him the throne, I've just accepted he could deal with its sale. That was the best decision and it has been also taken by Morgan and Elting.",
"I agree you took the right decision but the crew think you would have had asked their opinion before deciding.",
"I think in the past I always took the best decisions. I don't understand why now they question my leadership.",
"In fact, the crew believe more and more in someone.",
"Who?",
"Gauthier Thomassin.",
"Humm... Not surprising. These last months, I had the impression he would like to put in my place. He's dangerous.",
"What do you think of doing?",
"No time to waste, call him. I want to talk to him and prevent any mutineries.",
"Captain!",
"Emilio! What are you doing here, my friend?",
"I escaped from the ship when she was near the coast. I swimmed to the shore and ran as quickly as possible to Port Royale. I informed the Governor there were a mutiny aboard the ship and the crew would try to steal the throne. He told me the warship carrying the throne had left the port. He sent another ship to prevent the warship about the danger.",
"Don't worry, the danger is over. I saw off the island my beloved ship sunk by the warship. I didn't see any survivor of my former crew.",
"It was stupid from Thomassin thinking he could defeat the governor's warship.",
"Yes, he thought he was smarter than me. I regret not to have killed him with my own hands.", 
"I don't understand why the crew believed in this madman... Otherwise, how did you leave the islet?",
"By a ship, of course. The crew wanted to sell me to the Spanish. I've had to kill them. Their ship is small but she's in good conditions.",
"What's the next step?",
"I think the best solution is to go to #sConceicao# and see the Governor. I count on his help to give me some missions that we allow us to earn a lot of money in a short while.",
"So, I'll be with you during the capture of this ship?",
"No, I have a specific task for you. I knew there was a secret tunnel linking the Admiral's office to the fort. It is used to increase the garrison of San Felipe in case the fort is attacked. The only problem is the key is in the townhall in the Governor’s hands. So, go there and enter discreetly into the building from a window. The key should be in the Governor's desk. After finding the key, join Captain Queiroz in the Cartagena' square.",
"Bad news, Captain. Impossible to find the key...",
"What?! But the Governor told me he keeps the key in the townhall.",
"I looked for the key and be sure it isn't in the townhall. I and my companions, we have threatened the governor to kill him to tell the truth. He affirmed he must have lost the key this afternoon because this morning he still had the key with him. He said his only outing was his visit to the admiral office.",
"And what did you do with the Governor afterwards?",
"We tied him up, stunned him and closed in the bedroom cupboard.",
"Good, like that he won't warn the guards. Emilio, make me another favour.",
"Of course, what exactly?",
"Go to the cloister and bring back the Governor's daughter to the ship we seized.",
"Alright, I'll do my best.",
"Thanks!",
"She's here, Captain.",
"No difficulties to bring her back?",
"Let's say, I didn't tell her the truth about your real identity.",
"I'm going to deal with this part. Thank you Emilio. You can return to your post now.",
