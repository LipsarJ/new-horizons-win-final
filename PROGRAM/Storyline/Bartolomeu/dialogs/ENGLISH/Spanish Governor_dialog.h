"Don’t you know how to knock on the door before entering, Captain!",
"First, I didn’t enter by the door. Secondly, I’m not a Spanish Captain but a pirate one.",
"What are you talking about???!",
"I’m Bartolomeu o Portugues. I suppose you heard my name in the past.",
"Damn it! Guaarr..",
"SHUT UP! or I kill you where you stand.. Don't make a sound.",
"Alright, I’ll be quick. Where is Roxanne Lalliere?",
"What do you mean?",
"I mean you are wasting my time, Governor. You know some mercenaries kidnapped her and brought her back to this town but you are trying to lead me up the garden path. I give you a second and last chance : where is she?",
"Alright, don't get worked up... She isn’t here in town but has been moved to the fort.",
"Why the fort?",
"Because it’s more secure than the town prison.",
"Now, give me the name of these mercenaries.",
"Johan Elting and Nicholas Butcher.",
"Both are here?",
"No, only Elting. Butcher has already left for Havana.",
"Do you know if Emilio Soares, my officer, is with Roxanne?",
"No, she’s alone.",
"See my questions are easy. So, there is a jail in the fort?",
"Yes, under the fort.",
"Who has got the jail’s keys?",
"The Captain of the fort. However, there are too many soldiers there, you can’t free her. It's a mission impossible, you should give yourself up.",
"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, you say. I don’t think so, you under-estimate me. Is Elting there too?",
"I suppose so. He told me he wanted to look after Captain Lalliere until the reinforcements come from Havana. You know you don't stand a chance.",
"Well, I know enough now. Good night, Governor!",
