"That's done Captain! The ale has been loaded.",
"Excellent! Board the ship we are going to set sail for #sisland_Cuba# in a few minutes.",
"Wait a bit! This soldier is a deserter.",
"No, Captain. He was kidnapped by some brigands; I freed him.",
"If you tell the truth, you'll receive a reward. But for now follow me, I have to take you to the fort so that my commander questions you.",
"I'll go later.",
"Of course not. Until this issue is settled, you are my prisoners.",
"I won't obey you. So forget us, Captain.",
"I'm going to teach you the obedience.",
"I saw you killing this woman. Don't move!",
"Congratulations Captain! I heard you sank the 'Joyeuse'.",
"Now, you believe in my abilities?",
"I must say yes. Take the money : 20000 gold coins for that work. I'm in the habit of seeing almost each day a Captain who wants to work for me. So, it's hard for me to distinguish the good ones.",
"I understand. Otherwise, have you got a new mission for me?",
"Yes. Now I can trust you, I would like you go with one of my captains to #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"Why #sisland_Khael Roa#? It's a deserted island.",
"Indeed, but the British Crown wants we build a settlement there. The strategic localization of that island is important for the authorities.",
"So, it's an exploratory mission?",
"Yes. But let me introduce the Captain you'll accompany. Here's Captain Tripper, one of my best captains.",
"Ha! Here you are. Captain Tripper came a few minutes ago and told what happened on #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"The French are already there. We even had to fight one of their warships to leave the island.",
"I know. That's really annoying! I'll have to prepare a small fleet over the next weeks to definitively evict the French from #sisland_Khael Roa#. And I count on your help for that mission. Otherwise, take these 20000 gold coins. Captain Tripper said you were very efficient.",
"Thank you Admiral. Until the fleet is ready, maybe I could do some missions for you.",
"Well, at the moment I have nothing really interesting...",
"Are you sure? Even an escort mission for instance, my crew does not like to be idle for long?",
"Well, I'll see what I can do, Oh, I have got one, but I didn't think you would be interested in this kind of mission.",
"Why not?",
"I need to send a merchant ship to #sisland_Isla Mona#. I was thinking of asking one of my junior captains to escort it..",
"I'm interested. Let me accompany the ship.",
"Really?! But you'll earn little for the mission. Only 5000 gold coins.",
"That's not a problem. It will allow me and my crew to work until the new mission on #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"As you like. The captain of the merchant ship will be at the quay finishing loading, you only need to talk to him there. But before you meet him, you will need this free-pass that permits you to stay on #sisland_Isla Mona#.",
"Thank you Admiral. I will meet him at the quay!",
"Wait a bit, Captain!",
"Yes? What do you want?",
"I need to inform you that one of your men was arrested.",
"What? Where is he? Why did the authorities arrest him, if he is drunk again, I'll keel haul him?",
"He's in the Commander's House with Captain Wilfred Burman. He'll explain in detail the reasons of his custody.",
"How do I get to the Commander's house?",
"Just outside the port. You've got a way to go to get there.",
"Thank you. [THINKS: that act went over well, we'll need to be more careful.]",
"YOU HERE ?! TRAITOR !", 
"(Soldier talking to Vice-Admiral Benavides)",
"Excellency,  we are under attack!",
"I was with my company in the village near #sHavana#, checking if the smugglers didn't hid any wares in that location when many Dutch soldiers attacked us. I'm the only one who succeeded in escaping.",
"Don't worry, Captain Elting, your prisoner can't escape. I'll keep in the pocket of my uniform the jail's keys. Nobody will free this woman.",
"Thank you, Captain. She will only stay in the fort for a few days. Seeing the number of soldiers in this place, I agree she can't run away.",
"Nobody here, Captain! Are you sure they had to come here?",
"Yes... At least from what your Governor said. Maybe, they saw the troops following us and ran away. Let's wait a bit and if they don't come we'll go right to their ship.",
"Thanks, Captain! These dogs were about to execute us.",
"No problem...",
"Morgan, Bartolomeu and the traitor Elting... What a beautiful row of bastards!",
"(Elting to Caceres) I note I and my comrades are enough famous to be recognized at first time. However, seeing the words you use to define us, it seems you know how to receive visitors. That must be the well-known Spanish hospitality.",
"(Caceres to Elting) You are certainly here to steal the Aztec treasure but I won't let you leave my fort alive, small excrement of mosquito.",
"(Elting to Caceres) It's a shame to stain a suit so fine with blood but this is what you want. En garde!",
"Yes, who are you?",
"Let me introduce me, I'm Dom Guillermo, the envoy of our king...",
"Ah I know, I know... Dom Guillermo. I suppose you are here to obtain some information for your report.",
"Right, where is the Admiral?",
"He's not here. He's in mission with the Governor and his fleet.",
"Of course, I should have thought he would be with the Governor for the mission at Willemstad. I'm going to let you but just before, I saw in the Port a warship called San Martin. Can you tell me who's her Captain?",
"It's the Ortega' ship.",
"Sebastian Ortega? The suitor of Lucia Montavez?",
"Yes, Sir. The suitor of the Governor's daughter.",
"Humm.. Very well... I'll be again here after the Admiral's come back. Thank you for your help.", 
"My friend, you should move away of this house.",
"Who are you to talk to me like that? Don't you know who am I?",
"Yes, I know who you are. You're a maker of troubles since you came to Cartagena. I repeat for the last time, leave this square immediately otherwise your health could 'deteriorate' quickly.",
"Enough of this mummery! Nobody can threaten me. En garde!",
"Are you wounded? What's going on ?",
"Finally, you came. Is it like that soldiers defend people attacked by brigands in Cartagena?",
"Sorry, sir. That's the first time something so serious happens in the square.",
"Be more vigilant for the next time and be happy I don't report your behaviour to the Governor when he comes back.",
"My apologies, Sir. I won't commit such mistake again.",
"Yes?",
"Is it the Dom Ortega's House?",
"Yes, Sir. You came to talk to him ?",
"Yes, could you announce my coming?",
"Unfortunately, he's not here. He told me he had to see some people in the Townhall.",
"Ah.. Very well, I'm going there. Thank you for your help.",
"Sir, stop the fight. Dom Ortega is down.",
"I don't fight people down. He can be happy to be slightly wounded. Our dispute is over.",
"Sir?! It's a pleasure to see you again.",
"Thank you, Soldier. So, there was no problem here since the last time?",
"No, Dom Guillermo. Calm and quiet as usual.",
"And... Nothing in the rest of the town?",
"Well, I heard a Dutch Pirate was arrested in the cloister.",
"[THINKS: Dash it!] What do you mean?! Is it a joke? What a pirate can do in a cloister?",
"This is the same thought I've had when I knew that.",
"You don't have any more information about the arrest?",
"Nothing else. I heard the story from one of my companions this morning but I don't know the details.",
"Humm... Well, I liked speaking with you, however I must leave now. Have a good day, Soldier.",
"What do we have to do now?",
"Check inside the warship if there are more soldiers I can't believe we dealt with all of them.",
"Damn it!! Look at your back!!",
"Done! Captain. The ship is ours. It was an amazing duel on the yardarm",
"Thanks. Stay here with your companions, I'm going to join the Portuguese forces in the square. When the battle starts in the fort, sink any Spanish ships approaching the port. I don't want a ship shooting at the fort when fighting the fort's garrison.",
"You! Follow me, I need your help for the fight in the fort.",
"Wrong. Another one is on the Port side.",
"Thanks for the information.",
"ALARM!! ALARM!!",
"Damn it!",
"Captain! There are more soldiers in this side. I'm going there.",
"NO! WAIT FOR ME!",
"Aaarrgg... Sorry, Captain. I would have waited for you before fighting these soldiers.",
"Forget! Are you seriously wounded?",
"Not so much. But, I think I can't help you any more tonight.",
"Don't worry. We have almost finished the fight. Rest a bit here. After capturing the fort, I'll take you to our new warship.",
