"Hello Matey! What do you want?",
"Hello Sir, Are you Eugene Martin?",
"Ah Oui, Yes! How do you know my name? Why are you here?",
"I met Pierre Delacroix at #sPort au Prince#. He said that, maybe, you were looking to hire suitable Captains for your ships.",
"That Pierre, a good man, always on the lookout for new arrivals to the archipelago for me, I have a few positions, what experience do you have as a Captain?",
"I was Captain of a merchant ship for years in Portugal, I gave up that miserable life to make my fortune here.",
"Humm..previous experience and a desire for quick coin. You realize, my friend, I don't sell legal goods....",
"I understand. But, you pay according to the high risk for this work, do you not?",
"Of course. The pay depends on the goods you have to deliver. The more valuable the goods are, the higher your commission will be.",
"That's what I wanted to hear. So... do you have a ship for me?",
"More front than a sewer rat with a gold tooth, you may be just what I need. A few days ago, the captain of one of my ships was arrested by the French authorities at #sPort au Prince#..",
"I hope not because of your trade, I don't want to land in jail before I start.",
"No. This imbecile had a fight in the tavern and now he's in jail for ten days, my reputation for prompt delivery is at stake. I cannot afford to take him back after his release, he's too 'problematic'... you can have his job.",
"Excellent! I make a new friend, get a suitable position and a potential enemy -if that Captain ever finds out I took his job- all in one day. I love this place. When do I start?",
"Right now! I have commissioned to deliver a cargo of sandal to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# due in the next few weeks. My barque is moored at Boca de Hubon. Go to the tavern of this camp and look for Emilio Soares. He will be your officer during the voyage. In the meantime, I will send a runner to Boca de Hubon, to tell the crew that you are their new Captain.",
"Very well. I'm off to find Emilio.",
"Slow down for a minute! I have to warn you: Do not betray me or try to steal my ship and cargo because even if the crew doesn't kill you, I'll send some men after you to teach you a lesson. Savvy?",
"Don't worry. You can trust me, I need you as much as you need me, and I never forget a favour or help I receive.",
"You have two months to accomplish this mission or you forfeit your pay. Don't forget. If you succeed I'll pay you 10 000 gold coins. And before I forget, take this map it 'll help you get to know this archipelago.",
"Understood. See you soon!",
"Aha! Here you are. Did the voyage go well?",
"Yes, no major problems, and he gave me the silk.",
"Excellent, here's your commission: 10 000 gold coins. Note well, this money is not only for you, but also to pay the crew and buy provisions, anything else you make is yours to keep.",
"Thank you. This is good, coin as promised and no haggling over payment, I like this job!",
"Happy to know it, because it is back to work, you have to go to #sisland_Douwesen#.",
"Now?! I'll get provisions on the way, and who do I have to meet this time?",
"Another smuggler... Take the map of the island because he lives in the Pirate Fort and it's not easy to find it. He will give you a cargo of ale for my linen. Of course, you only have two months to return with the Ale.",
"Well, I hope everything goes smoothly. See you!",
"At last, you are back!",
"As you can see, I have the ale as planned.",
"Good job. Here's your 8 000 gold coins.",
"HA! if this work keeps up, I could buy your barque.",
"Really? are you interested in that old ship, many a true word has been said in jest?",
"I was joking. But why not, the future would be my own?! How much would it take for you to part with her, she is old but sound?",
"I could let her go for the low sum of 35 000 gold coins, I was thinking that I could use a bigger cargo capacity, lately. It's a good price. In a shipyard, you would pay much more for a such barque. It is a shame that you want to move on already? I'm a bit annoyed, you're a good Captain.",
"Thank you, I would like to have my own ship and crew, we could work harder and earn much more.",
"That's understandable, you have ambition. Do you want a new mission or do you want to resign now?",
"No, I'd like to have another mission. I need to learn and earn more before leaving you.",
"Well, I have a simple mission : deliver a cargo of cinnamon to Jean Maginot the shopkeeper at #sMarigot#.",
"What? I didn't know a shopkeeper could buy contraband.",
"HA-HA! Normally, he can't... But he pays the soldiers to look the other way and we all get richer.",
"That's the Caribbean! HA-HA! I'm not going to lose any time. Before two months is up, I'll be back here to buy your barque. I trust that you will be true to your word!",
"Here you are then! What happened?",
"I didn't have any problems. I have the tobacco in exchange. This is a great business. Oh and Jean sends his regards.",
"Wonderful! Take your commission : 7 000 gold coins. Now, are you still interested in buying my barque?",
"Yes, I saved 35 000 gold coins. Take the money.",
"Yes, but I need few days to get the 35 000 gold coins needed.",
"I don't have any missions for the next 10 days. So if you want to buy the barque, I want this sum before this date. Savvy?",
"Yes, You'll have the money before 10 days are up. See you soon!",
"Bartolomeu! Have you got the money, I have commissioned the new ship, and I hold you to your word?",
"Thanks Bartolomeu. This money will help me to pay for the new one. So are you sure you want to leave my employ? I must warn you that there are many dangers out there.",
"Indeed, I will. It has been a pleasure to work for you. Maybe I could see you again in the future.",
"Who knows, I may have work for you! Come back as you like, even if only for a rest. I am proud you worked for me, my reputation is intact, you will always be safe here.",
"Thanks. Goodbye Eugene!",
"What are you doing here?",
"Sorry my mistake.",
"Are you OK, Bartolomeu! Did you get your ship back?!",
"No, unfortunately. I arrived too late, the 'Santiago' was weighing anchor.",
"And you don't know where she's heading?",
"No idea. I succeeded in arresting some of Pedro Rivera's men but they didn't know where their captain was going.",
"That rotten Rivera, you know he once worked for me - I fired him - so arrogant, angry and sadistic when he's on the rum. What will you do now?",
"Yes, Emilio told me of him, a bit late, but better late than never. Anyway, I want to recover my ship, but first I have to find a temporary one, even small, or I am dead in the water.",
"Humm.. Let me help you. I've got an old ketch, I could lend her to you until you can buy or steal a bigger one.",
"Thanks Eugene! It's really kind of you. You're right. I'll go in search of a bigger one and I'll bring back your ketch.", 
"Good. As usual, the ship will be moored at Boca de Hubon. I hope you'll find the 'Santiago' in the future.",
"I hope so. Thanks again and see you soon!",
"Bartolomeu! How do you do? Have you come to return my ketch?",
"No, I have even more bad news. I succeeded in stealing a galleon off #sisland_Isla Muelle# a while ago but the Spanish caught us and arrested me and my crew off #sisland_Redmond#. I escaped from them at #sSanto Domingo#. I could use your help to recover the galleon.",
"Don't worry about that old ketch, she was due to be retired anyway. Is the galleon still in the #sSanto Domingo# Port, what about your men?",
"Yes, she is still there, my crew are imprisoned onboard!",
"It's a dangerous task stealing a ship in a Spanish port. Are you certain you want to do that?",
"Yes, I am. I have a plan to get into the town without being recognized.",
"How can I help?",
"I just need some experienced pirates to assist me in this work.",
"Well, I may have part of the solution. I know two very good pirates. Maybe you would have expected more but at the moment I can't do better.",
"True, I had hoped for more, but something is always better than nothing. Could I meet them right now, time is short?",
"Of course, follow me, they live here in Camp.",
"Let's go.",
"Here are 'your' men. Adriance Blind and Benoit Belcour.",
"Thanks a lot.",
"Eugene said you want to get your ship back in port at #sSanto Domingo#.",
"Right. But don't worry we'll take a minimum of risks.",
"Only by some trick, could that be done.",
"Yes, that's exactly what I have planned to do, trick the soldiers.",
"I hope everything will go as expected,.",
"Thank you so much for your help. I have to go now. Thanks again, Eugene, see you soon!",
"Do you want us to come with you now.",
"No, you and Benoit stay here and protect my back. I wouldn't like to be taken from behind if some soldiers happen to appear.",
"How did you go?",
"Great, we have released the crew. What about you, did any soldier come?",
"No, at the moment, they haven't noticed our presence.",
"Excellent, so far a complete surprise.",
"You have done well, me and Benoit, we don't work for anyone. If we succeed in seizing your ship, we want to be your officers, as reward like. Do you agree?",
"We have an accord, I know I can trust you as Eugene has vouched for you.",
"Bartolomeu! Nice to see you! What have you done since your last stay here in camp?",
"It's a long story, Eugene.",
"I've heard you attacked the #sSantiago#'s warehouses.",
"That's true with the French pirate Roxanne Lalliere.",
"She's a good pirate.",
"So true, nice too, we had a fine affair, I was lucky to meet her. Does she still live in #sisland_Hispaniola#?",
"I don't think so. I've heard she's moved to #sPointe a Pitre#. But, tell me what else has happened.",
"Many things. The most important was that we captured Charles Baxter.",
"Charles Baxter?! The famous pirate? How is it possible?",
"The Governor of #sisland_Conceicao# gave me the mission to arrest him in order to stop his raids on the Portuguese colony. I tracked him to #sCharlestown#, caught him and took him to the Governor.",
"He's got a bad reputation, a real black pirate.",
"It seems he had, note the past tense, he's no longer a problem. Let's talk about something else. I have some goods I'd like to sell.",
"What exactly do you have?",
"Sugar, cinnamon and fruits. Are you interested?",
"Of course, what are the quantities?",
"250 for the sugar, 200 for....",
