"Yes? What do you want?",
"Hello Sir, I'm captain and...",
"A captain? Have you come to work for me?",
"Why do you say that?",
"It seems you don't know who I am. I'm Gherarde de Jongh, the Director-General of the Dutch West India Company. The company is growing and we trade a lot. We hire new captains continuously. So, you are not here to work for me?", 
"No, Sir. I'd like to obtain some information about the unexplored area of the island.",
"Why are you interested in that area? If you want to buy lands, there are more than enough near the town and much better than that mountainous country.",
"I don't want to be landowner Sir. In fact, I'm looking for a friend, captain of a small ship. I heard he may have sunk around that part of the island. Two weeks ago, he was to deliver some wares to me and I am concerned.",
"Why do you think he would have sunk there and not somewhere else or maybe even another Island?",
"If he survived the shipwreck anywhere else, he would have sent me a message, here he would be lost in the unexplored jungle. The fact that there is no path over the mountains and natives, I need to look here first, or he could be lost.",
"Humm... I understand. But I can't help you in this rescue mission, Captain. We have some information that the Spaniards are preparing an operation to attack #sWillemstad#. So, the governor won't send any navy ships from this area to help you in your search.",
"The Spaniards you say? Have you seen a Spanish Battleship....?",
"No, Why did you ask? Have you got information about the presence of a Spanish battleship near the island?",
"Humm.. Well.... I thought to have seen one heading for Curaçao during my voyage but I'm not sure. The ship was far off and I could be mistaken. Anyway, I don't need the help of the Dutch Navy, I have a ship. I'd just like to know the best way to reach this area. I can search alone, if need be.",
"Well, there is a small shore in the northern area of the island. It's the only shore we discovered along that rocky coast. We didn't explore much the lands around seeing this area can't be colonized. I can't help you any more than this.",
"Thank you Sir, you helped enough. I have to go and start my search.",
"Here you are... Have you found your friend?",
"What are you doing here? I thought you couldn't help.",
"I changed my mind, especially when a citizen of #sWillemstad# came asking me why François l'Ollonais was in my office. Thanks to him, I know you are pirates and my governor certainly will be happy to hear I arrested dangerous pirates. By the way, where is L'Ollonais?",
"He's sunbathing on a beach.",
"Don't be funny... What's this you have in your hand? A golden statuette? I bet you stole it from the indians. Give it to me!",
"*ironic tone* I don't understand, since I've found this indian idol, I only meet people wanting to take it.",
"This statuette was found on this island so it belongs to the Dutch authorities.",
"Do you know that teaching the law to a pirate is like pissing into the wind?",
"What?! Alright, I'm wasting my time with you. Maybe, the soldiers will be more persuasive.",
"SHOW TIME!",
