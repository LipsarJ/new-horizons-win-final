"Captain Bartolomeu?",
"Yes... Captain Queiroz, I presume.",
"Did you accept the mission?",
"I did. Is your ship ready to sail?",
"Yes, Captain. We can leave the island right now.",
"Thank you. Let me speak with my officer before we embark.",
"Can we board the ship now?",
"Yes, let’s go.",
"So, you think the Spanish soldiers are in the jungle?",
"Yes, with Captain Arturo Campos seeing he wasn't on his ship.",
"Are we going to wait and ambush them at this shore?",
"No. As you know, the best defence is offence. Let’s head into the jungle, find and kill them all. ",
"Done! He’s dead.",
"We accomplished our mission. No need to stay any longer on this island, infested with pirates and parasites. Let’s return to #sConceicao#.",
"I will let you see the Governor alone. Now I command 'A Faisca' again, I need to prepare her for my next mission.",
"Of course. You don't need to accompany me to the Townhall, I'll report of your good deeds.",
"It was an honour to work with you. Goodbye Captain.",
"Thank you, see you again sometime I hope.",
"Captain Bartolomeu!",
"Good to see you, Captain Queiroz. A long time has passed from our last meet.",
"Indeed. Now, our new mission is much more important.",
"No doubt. Do you know the details of the mission?",
"Yes. I talked many times to the Governor these last days. I and my men will be hidden in the ship until start the attack.",
"Right. I'll be also helped by a Dutch friend, Captain Elting; you can see him nearby. He'll follow us to Cartagena.",
"Good to hear. But, Governor Barreto told me we could also have the help of Dutch soldiers. Is it true?",
"I confirm. If we have the possibility of a military action, the Dutch will help us.",
"Well, I think we are ready for starting the mission. Do we go right now?",
"Yes, let's go. We have a lot to do.",
"What happened with the Governor?",
"Everything is fine. He invited me for a party tonight in his residence.",
"(Ironic tone) Much better than my situation.",
"Sorry, if you must stay in the ship. I'll try to find a way to attack the town as quickly as possible in order to reduce your waiting.",
"Finally, the Governor is back. This waiting was endless, I look forward the operation starts.",
"We must still wait the Captain Elting's come back. I hope nothing serious happened to him.",
"What will you do today?",
"Of course, I need to talk to the Governor. I want to know if his mission has failed as I wish. Don't worry Captain, your waiting is about to finish. I'm sure our operation will start in a few days.",
"And what about the operation?",
"Tomorrow night, the operation will start. The details will be explained here, just after my visit to the Governor.",
"Very well, everybody waits impatiently for this moment.",
"I know. Tomorrow, what we'll do will be remembered as the greatest battle against the Spanish.",
"So, you mean, I and my men will attack the fort by the tunnel?",
"Right. Before that, kill all the guards between the port and the square. Be discreet and hide the corpses, I don't want the town warned by the Portuguese troops. If possible, I'll try to catch you at the square after capturing the warship.",
"Thanks to God. Here you are! Did you capture the ship?",
"Of course, Captain Queiroz. But I thought you would be already in the tunnel. Where is Emilio?",
"That's the problem. He didn't still bring the key for the door. Wait! He's just entered the square.",
"So, let's go and search the key in the admiral's office.",
"Right.",
"Almost half an hour lost and impossible to find it. The situation is really bad.",
"We still have a possibility to find the key. His daughter's house is also in the square. Maybe, he went there to check if anything is fine seeing his daughter will be home soon after I leave Cartagena.",
"You're right. There is a chance to find the key there.",
"Stay here. I'm going to check that and be back quickly.",
"So?",
"I have a key!",
"Great! Captain.",
"Wait, wait... The problem is this key doesn't seem to be a key to open the tunnel door but for something else.",
"Don't tell me it is not the right key...",
"Humm... Maybe it's used for a kind of mechanical system that opens the door. Give me a few minutes, I'm going to try something.",
"You're right. I've never thought the Spanish could make a such thing to protect the tunnel.",
"A smart idea, indeed. The Governor and Admiral never said there was a system in the clock that allows to open the door.",
"Now, we just need to find the right way to the fort.",
"Yes, follow me and be careful. We don't know if there are guards in this location.",
"I didn't expect a fight here.",
"That's why I said we should be careful. Let's go Captain Queiroz, I suspect we are close to the fort now.",
"The tunnel was like a labyrinth.",
"Yes. At least we are inside the fort. Now, we must move quickly. Let's go!",
"What?",
"The door is locked.",
"Again! Don't tell me there is another system to open this door like the Admiral's office one.",
"I hope not.",
"I have an idea but no sure it's a good one. What do you think of placing a grenade with a long fuse to destroy the lock?",
"That would work of course. However, we don't know if there are soldiers in this location. And if our presence is detected our operation is over.",
"So, what do you suggest?",
"I'm going to look for anything here that can help me to open the door. Wait a bit...",
"Congratulations again, Captain!",
"Thanks. Fortunately, the Spanish doesn't know to protect his own security systems. Let's go on our mission.",
"What luck! We saw this one before he goes to warn his companions.",
"Indeed. As you said, we are lucky. We should be close to the exit. Follow me, Captain Queiroz.",
"I only see one soldier in this side.",
"Humm...",
"Even two is not a problem for me. I just need to use my poisoned knives to kill them discreetly. Afterwards, I'll check if Captain Elting and the Dutch troops are ready to attack.",
"That sounds good. I and my soldiers will wait here until your return. Good luck.",
"They are firing at us!",
"GO BACK WHERE WE WERE! WE ARE EXPOSED HERE!",
"Did you see from which location they are shooting?",
"Yes, from the top of the fort.",
"You didn't tell me the Spanish had installed cannons there.",
"Because the last time I visited the fort they weren't. Anyway, I don't think these are cannons. I don't see them.",
"Mortar?",
"I think so. A mortar can be easily and quickly installed.",
"We lost the surprise effect. The situation is worst for us now.",
"Captain Elting and Dierman certainly have started the assault so we must counterattack. The problem is we don't have some powerful weapons to annihilate a maximum of soldiers quickly.",
"Don't worry. I have a solution for that. Some of my men have a rocket weapon that can kill people instantly.",
"Excellent! Ask your soldiers to equip the rockets. We must reach the other side of this location as quickly as possible to avoid the mortar's fires.",
"WAKE UP, CAPTAIN! Are you ok?!",
"What happened?",
"An explosion occurred close to you.",
"We must destroy the mortar as soon as possible",
"Indeed. Let's go now. New enemy troops are coming.",
"This section is 'clean'.",
"Let's continue our way.",
"Now, they are firing at the Dutch troops!",
"They must have a second mortar and not only one as we've thought. Let's move quickly.",
"And now the top of the fort?",
"Yes, follow me. We are going to make definitively the mortars be quiet.",
"Captain Elting and Dierman are just downstairs.",
"Good! Let's see them to celebrate our victory.",
"Wait! Not yet. They are still fighting the Spanish.",
"What?! we didn't kill all of them around this area?!",
"I don't understand too but we must help them quickly.",
"How quickly? If we need a few minutes to join them.",
"Take this musket. It's a powerful weapon and you'll be able to kill the soldiers from the wall.",
"Thanks! I go right now.",
"Can we weigh anchor and return to #sConceicao#?",
"Give me half-an-hour before leaving Cartagena, I need to talk to someone. Of course, you'll sail the Spanish envoy ship, now I have my new warship.",
"Finally at home!",
"Indeed. By the way, I forgot to do that in Cartagena but here's your musket back.",
"No, keep it.",
"What?! But this weapon is very expensive.", 
"Yes, but you deserve it for what you did there. Consider it as a sign of our friendship.",
"Thank you Captain Queiroz. I won't forget that.",
"I go right now to the Townhall to bring some good news to the Governor.",
"Excellent. I'll be there in a few minutes.",
