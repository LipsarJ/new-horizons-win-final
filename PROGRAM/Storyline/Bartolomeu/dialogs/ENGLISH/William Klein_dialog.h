"What do you want?",
"Sorry to disturb, I am Bartolomeu o Portugues. You're quite a pirate yourself, aren't you? Perhaps you can help me with something.",
"What did you have in mind?",
"I have to save my crew.",
"I don't understand. What happened to your crew that you have to save them?",
"A few weeks ago, I met a Spanish battleship at #sisland_Khael Roa#. She was a much larger ship than I could take, so I had to flee. Unfortunately we were caught up in a violent storm and my already damaged ship sank. We washed ashore at #sisland_Cuba#. But we stumbled upon a patrol of Spanish guards while crossing the jungle there. I contrived to escape but my crew was captured.",
"You should be glad to be out of there. Do you really intend to go back?",
"My crew are my friends. I will not leave them. I just need some men and a ship to rescue them.",
"I see. And what should I gain by it?",
"I might be famous, but I am not a wealthy pirate. Even if I save my crew, I won't be able to get another ship. I do not intend to stop pirating though and I'm sure my mates will follow me wherever I go. We have a lot of experience in these waters, so we could join your crew.",
"That sounds pretty good, men with experience are hard to find. We have an accord. Let's set sail for #sisland_Cuba#.",
"Fantastic! I'm certain you won't regret having additional able-bodied hands aboard.",
"Do you hear what I hear?",
"Dash it! There are Spanish guards coming. They must think we are smugglers.",
"Or they saw you walking around on the ship's deck. I TOLD you to stay below decks.",
"Prepare to fight!",
"This island is infested with soldiers!",
"Indeed. The Spaniards have patrols everywhere. Let's get to the city quickly! I don't intend to stay here longer than necessary.",
"Hey! Who are you?",
"My name is Feliciano Rojas. I am a merchant and I came here to sell some goods to your shopkeeper. He's waiting for me.",
"I have to check your credentials with the shopkeeper. Wait here!",
"Why such precautions? This is the first time I have been stopped when just entering a town to sell some goods.",
"When pirates are hanged in public, we have to check the identity of all foreigners - precautions you see.",
"A hanging, I don't want to miss a good hanging? Who are being hung?",
"The crew members of a certain Bartolomeu o Portugues. He is a very dangerous pirate and the same goes for his crew.",
"When are they going to be hung? And where?",
"Today at noon in front of the church. But you seem to have an awful lot of interest in that hanging. Do you know these pirates? If so, just inform me and I'll arrange some rope for one more hanging.",
"There's no time to lose, William! These soldiers aren't going to let us through any time soon, so we must fight our way in!",
"Let's go before more guards show up. We don't have much time; it's almost noon.",
"I agree. I just hope we're not too late.",
"Your men are in this small square, lined up for the execution.",
"I see them.",
"So what's your plan?",
"I'm going to talk to the hangman.",
"*Sarcastic Tone* And in the unlikely event that he won't just let your men go?",
"Then I'll let my blade do the talking. While I take care of him, you should attack the soldiers.",
"It won't be easy.",
"I know, but what choice do we have?",
"What are you doing here?",
"I want to have a better view of the execution.",
"You like to show off, do you? Let's watch how you show off with your head in a noose!",
"You enjoy killing, don't you? Hangman must've been you're perfect career choice. Unfortunately, that career will soon be over.",
"That was an hard fight!",
"Hah! My men were almost beginning to think I'd leave them to die with the Spaniards! But wait! Where is Emilio?",
"We don't have time to talk right now. We must leave now. There are bound to be more soldiers coming.",
"You're right. Let's go!",
"We did it! We escaped! That wasn't so hard.",
"No, it wasn't. That's what worries me. It was too easy to get out of the city.",
"Don't worry, be happy!",
"Look! A patrol of Spanish soldiers! Do you really want me to be happy about that? Get ready for another fight!",
"You were right. We aren't safe yet. Let's hope this is the last encounter with these Spanish soldiers. I've seen enough iron armour to last me a lifetime. We'd better get off this island quickly.",
"Let's go back to the ship!",
"Excuse me but who's Emilio?",
"Emilio Soares is my right-hand man.",
"If we want to find that man, we'd best go to #sSantiago# and see what we can find out there. Perhaps some sailor in port will have seen him. But we'd better go there quickly before word of our exploits arrive there.",
"Indeed!",
"(A few minutes later) Your men are aboard!",
"Excellent. Let's get going.",
"It seems we found all your men.",
"Thanks a lot. They are rescued now. Now all we need to do is to get away from here.",
"Indeed. How about we go to #sisland_Redmond#? Emilio here seems to like #sisland_Redmond#.",
"That would be great, captain. #sisland_Redmond# is my pied-a-terre. I would love to go there before we begin our joint raiding campaign.",
"A raiding campaign? You seem to have quite some plans. Sounds good to me!",
"I will tell you more when we arrive.",
"Hello, captain!",
"Do I know you?",
"Probably not. But I imagine you do know my boss.",
"Perhaps. Who is he?",
"Ernesto Guevara, the governor of #sHavana#.",
"Right. I was rather hoping we'd be rid of the Spanish by now. But here we are, supposedly safe in #sisland_Redmond#, and still we are being confronted by mercenaries.",
"You catch on pretty quickly. This square is surrounded by my men, so don't even think about escaping. You and your friend will follow us to our ship and we will deliver you to the governor.",
"I think not. If we fight you now, we'll have a chance of surviving. If we surrender and follow you to the governor, we are sure to be hanged.",
"Have it your way then. Prepare to die!",
"It won't be me who will be dying. I can assure you of that!",
"That's horrible! Our Captain was a good man. Now, what are we to do without him?",
"If all the crew agree, I would be proud to be your new Captain. But the decision is yours to make...",
"Nobody in our crew has your experience. So it would be an honour to have you as our new Captain.",
"Thank you all. I am sure that Captain Klein is happy now that his ship is in good hands. I swear to be fair with all the crew and officers. Now we have an accord, we should leave here and plan our future!",
