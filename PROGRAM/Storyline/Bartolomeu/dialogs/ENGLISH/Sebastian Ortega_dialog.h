"'This man', as you call me, has a name, Gentleman... And I think she doesn't need your help.",
"'And I think' she's old enough to answer my questions.",
"(Talking to Lady Montavez)",
"was I? Very well, we'll continue our meeting later and this time without being stopped.",
"You? What do you want?",
"I need the truth about an event. I want to know if you paid the men I've fought in front of the Lady Montavez house?",
"I learned this story of fight in the Palace square. But, I don't understand why you blame me to be involved in this event. It seems you like provoking people. You should be wiser in your behaviour.",
"I'm not stupid, Don Sebastian. They didn't want to steal my money, they weren't thiefs. They wanted me far from Lady Montavez. And I only know one person in Cartagena who had a reason to see me away from her.",
"You bother me with your accusations. Maybe you're foolish but that's your problem, so leave me alone before I lose my patience.",
"Better be a foolish than a liar and coward.",
"What?! Present your apologies immediately or I will defend my honour with a duel.",
"A duel? Why not. I've never walk away from a fight.",
"You're really arrogant, aren't you? En garde!",
"I can't believe... Don Guillermo?!",
"Your mistake, I'm not the King's envoy, it was just a cover for my mission, I'm Bartolomeu o Portuguese.", 
"The famous pirate himself. That's a shame not to have kill you if I had known sooner.",
"What do you say that? You weren't able to kill me neither in the townhall's garden or when you sent your mercenaries to the square.",
"In both cases, It was not my intention to kill you but to give a good lesson to let you far from Lucia.",
"She doesn't love men like you. You have no honour.",
"Such words from a pirate is a bit funny, isn't it?",
"My friends know who I am really and that's the most important. I don't care about your opinion. So, let's go straight what's matter. Surrender and I let you alive.",
"Well... It seems you're a good fighter from what I saw the last time and I am not sure to win a duel against you. So, I accept...",
"At least, you're realist. I like that. Drop your weapons and go down to the deck to order your soldiers to surrender.",
"Maybe, you forgot but I'm not a sailor. I belong to the Spanish nobility. I will only surrender giving you my weapons. Hand to Hand...",
"Alright, I won't spend my time discussing the way you want to surrender. So, I go up to you to give me the weapons and quickly order your men to surrender. I have more to do tonight.",
