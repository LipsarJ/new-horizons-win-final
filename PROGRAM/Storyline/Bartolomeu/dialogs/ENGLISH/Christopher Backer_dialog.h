"What's your problem?! Can't you see that I'm busy!",
"Sorry mate but I'm looking for a certain Captain.",
"A Captain? There are so many captains in this confounded island! Be clearer!",
"Charles is his name.",
"Charles?! humm... What do you want exactly?",
"You know him?",
"Humm.. No, but maybe I could talk to a friend. He may be willing to help you.",
"Interesting. Who's this man?",
"He lives in the town but before I talk to him, tell me why you're looking for this Charles.",
"Well, I am an old friend of his and I would like to see him again, we may be able to sail together.",
"Really?! What's your name?",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"Alright. Wait in the outskirts of town tonight at eleven o'clock. I'll be there with my friend.",
"Why not now?!",
"If you want to see your 'old' friend Charles do what I say.",
"Ok, I'll be there!",
"You are punctual at least.",
"So where's your friend? Have you already talked to him about Charles?",
"Yes, but he's not here.",
"What do you mean?",
"In fact, this man IS the real old friend of Charles. I talked to him and he confirmed Charles doesn't know 'any' Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"Your friend made a mistake.",
"I don't think so. I think you are a BIG liar.",
"I don't like the way you talk.",
"Too bad! I know there are many captains willing to arrest Charles in order to earn a reward. I think you are one of them.",
"Ok, you're right. I'm fed up with this game. Tell me where is Charles before I loose my temper and you loose your life.",
"Go to Hell, barbarian!",
"Bad answer!",
"Don't kill me!!",
"Of course, I won't. Did you forget? I want to know where this scum, Charles, lives!",
"I don't know. He often changes his location. Only, some of his best friends know where he lives.",
"OK, I believe you. Let's go to the house of his old friend. You said he lives in town.",
"Yes, but he left #sTortuga# this afternoon. And I don't know when he will return.",
"You are lying again aren't you? Do you want to die right now?",
"NO, Please! I swear I tell the truth, he left to warn Charles about you!",
"Dash it! I can't believe I'm going to lose Charles! Don't you have any idea who could help me? Think once more!",
"I understand that Charles has worked for the #sisland_Turks#' pirate chief recently. Maybe, you could find more information there.",
"Maybe. I found out that Charles was to meet François L'Ollonais. Do you know if this French pirate also worked for the pirate chief?",
"Yes, he did. But you should avoid meeting L'Ollonais. He's a 'wild beast', much more cruel and nasty than Charles.",
"I know his reputation and I'm only interested in Charles. You can go but if I learn you lied, I'll come back to #sTortuga# and I'll kill you.",
"I have told you all I know, I swear it!",
"Alright, leave now, before I change my mind!",
