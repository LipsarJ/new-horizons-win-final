"Wait a moment my 'friend', what are you doing here?",
"And you? what are you doing with all these wares?",
"*Menacing Tone* Are you working for the Spanish authorities? Because if you are, I can tell you are in trouble.",
"I understand. You are smuggler, aren't you? Don't worry I'm not working for them. But, you're right I'm in trouble.",
"Now, it's my turn not to understand...",
"I explain. I'm captain and my ship has sunk during the storm. Some of my crew and I were in the jungle when we met a Spanish patrol..",
"And you asked for help right?",
"I don't think so, it would not have been the best solution in my case.",
"HA-HA! I bet you are PIRATE!",
"Yes and wanted by the Spanish. I succeeded in escaping from the patrol but not my crew.",
"What's your name?",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"Of course! You attacked the #sSantiago#'s warehouses a while ago. The Spanish did not like your brazen defiance at all.",
"Indeed, I did when working with a French pirate.",
"Yes, I can confirm you are on their most wanted list. They even have sent a mercenary after you... Pedro Rivera.",
"Pedro Rivera?! He once worked for me! He even stole my ship.",
"HA-HA! I don't know why but now he works for the Spanish authorities.",
"I know the reason. This scum is an opportunist!",
"No doubt you are in the soup and they are adding more wood to the fire!",
"Are you willing to help me?",
"It depends on what you want me to do.",
"I'd like you help me to attack the patrol before it reaches #sHavana#.",
"Wait! I'm willing to help you but not to die for you!",
"I swear I will give you a reward...",
"No, reward or no reward it is far too dangerous! Smuggling is one thing, killing soldiers is another.",
"Well, I have to free my men... but how, I can't do it alone",
"I have an option, I can take you with me to #sisland_Cayman#. I have to go there to sell some goods. Maybe you could find an English captain to help in saving your crew, they don't like the Spanish either?",
"Sounds like a good plan, anyway I have no other options. I just hope I'll be back in time to save my crew.",
"That's done. I've loaded my wares, the tide is making and the weather is fine, we are right to go. I'll let you sail my ship if you want, I am sure to learn much from you.",
"Thanks. I've no time to loose.",
"We've arrived at our destination. I am sorry I could not be of more help, but you understand my situation?",
"Don't worry, you helped me enough. Now, it's my job to find a solution.",
"Good luck captain, fair winds and may Neptune be with you!",
"Thanks again. See you!",
