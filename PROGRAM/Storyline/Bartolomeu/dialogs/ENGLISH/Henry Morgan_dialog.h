"Can you not see, I'm busy?",
"Sorry but I'm ",
" Captain of the '",
" I've heard you're preparing an expedition and you need a partner.",
"True, and you think that your good enough to take part in this adventure?",
"Yes. But, I'd like to know some more details about it, before committing to it. I don't have time for wild goose chases.",
"Well, I know that the Spaniards discovered a big deposit of silver somewhere in the archipelago two years ago...",
"I've never heard of it before, something this important would surely be spoken of. How is it that you found out about it?",
"I captured a Spanish galleon a few weeks ago. Aboard there was an official from #sSantiago#. He gave me this information in exchange for his life.",
"And you believed him?! Maybe, he only concocted this story so you would let him go.",
"You think me a fool, boy.. of course I didn't release him. He's now a prisoner on #sTortuga# and I'll only let him go after confirming if the information is correct...maybe.",
"And where is the deposit of silver?", 
"Well, he told me it was on a deserted island in the middle of the archipelago.",
"It could be #sisland_Battle Rocks#...",
"Do you know where to find this island?",
"Yes, I could take you there. I've never stopped there. It seems to be quite inhospitable and no good anchorages. The coast is jagged rock mostly.",
"If the Spaniards have settled the island, I think they must have found an anchorage, or made one, we can use it can't we?",
"Yes, of course. And if your prisoner is right about the loot and we get our hands on it, what then...?",
"The stolen silver will be sold at #sTortuga# and we'll fairly share the profits. Do we have an accord?",
"Indeed, we could earn a lot.... Yes, we have an accord. When will you be ready to leave #sTortuga#?",
"I have the feeling that the expedition is too risky. You should look for someone else.",
"Well captain, maybe I'll see you again one day.",
"Maybe, goodbye!",
"Excellent! I've already made the preparations so we can go right now. But before we do, let me introduce our third partner, my old famous friend Edwaert, Captain Mansveldt to you. He will help us during the expedition.",
"Finally, we found a safe anchorage.",
"Indeed, I was right when I said the coast was jagged rock, very dangerous for our ships. Let's explore the jungle, we need to determine if and where the Spaniards have settled the island.",
"Me neither!",
"Now, we are so close to the goal, I'm not willing to give up.",
"Dash it! He escaped.",
"NOT GOOD! He will warn the convoy...",
"The jig is up. We have no choice but to attack the convoy... now.",
"I agree. Let's go.",
"I checked the boxes... they are all full of silver. What luck. What a haul.", 
"I love hearing news like this! Let's head to the ships. I want the silver under the protection of our cannons, as soon as possible, we can't lose it now.",
"The sale of the silver has yielded 150 000 gold coins. Normally, it would be 75 000 for each one. But it would be only fair to give a portion to Konrad Kulczycki and his companions right?",
"Exactly, Captain Morgan. They deserve it. Their help has been decisive. What do you think about 30 000 gold coins for them?",
"I agree. So, there will be 60 000 for each partner, a fine sum indeed. That Spanish official has earned his release. I must be in a good mood.",
"Excellent! This expedition has been very profitable, a complete success for all.",
"Captain Bartolomeu?! Nice to see you.",
"Thank you, Sir. It's a pleasure to meet you again. I knew you were working for the Governor.",
"Indeed, he gives me a lot of tasks and pays well for that.",
"Good for you! I don't have any new expeditions in mind. Do you think he would be interested in my services?",
"Of course. But, in fact, I would be interested first.",
"What do you mean?",
"There is a possibility I do an expedition over the next two or three months.",
"What's the goal of the expedition?",
"Seize an Aztec treasure.",
"Humm...",
"You don't seem to be filled with enthusiasm Ha! Ha! Maybe, I wouldn't have talked about that.",
"Let's say the last time I looked for an Indian treasure, I only earned trouble... not gold.",
"Don't worry, Captain. I'll only start the expedition if I'm sure it will be profitable.",
"Do you mean you still need more information about that treasure before embarking on the expedition?",
"Right and you could help me for that.",
"In what way?",
"Follow me to my cabin so that I can give you the details of the story.",
"Here are the details. I knew the Spanish found recently a treasure in an abandoned Aztec town lost in the jungle.",
"Where exactly?",
"Near Vera Cruz.", 
"Are you sure?",
"No, unfortunately. I need a confirmation. That's why I want to send someone to Vera Cruz in order to know if the treasure really exists, what are the objects making up the treasure and if the destination of that treasure is Spain.",
"You think the treasure will be sent to Spain?",
"Yes, if the treasure is so valuable as I heard, it will directly go to the Spanish Crown. In this case, the treasure will be guarded in Vera Cruz before being...",
"loaded in the Silver Fleet.",
"I see you know Vera Cruz is one of the ports of the Caribbean the Silver Fleet moors.",
"Not hard. There aren't a lot of ports where the Silver Fleet stops.",     
"Right. Are you interested in this mission?",
"Yes, Captain. I' m able to bring back the information.",
"Good! As soon as you've got it go back quickly. We must attack Vera Cruz before the Silver Fleet arrives. Otherwise, we could lose our unique opportunity.",
"I understand. I go right now.",
"You are back, Elting and Bartolomeu! What are the news?",
"We won't attack Vera Cruz, Captain.",
"What? Don't tell me the treasure disappeared or left the Caribbean.",
"No, it's still in the Caribbean but in Cuba.",
"What is it doing there?",
"The Silver Fleet left Vera Cruz sooner than expected maybe because they wanted to call in at Havana before heading for Spain.",
"Damn it! Gentlemen, we must quickly go to Havana. We don't know how long will be her stay. It could be our last lucky break to steal the treasure. Prepare your ships, we weigh anchor!",
"Yes, Captain.",
"Alright, the fleet is still in Havana. But we must know if the treasure is in the ships or on land and how long the fleet will stay, hoping we have enough time for the theft. Can you both get these information?",
"I think so. With Captain Elting, we'll find a stratagem.",
"Be quick! We can't indefinitely let our ships near Havana. This would be too dangerous.",
"Understood.",
"What is a priest doing in my ship?",
"He isn't priest. We dressed him with a robe only for leaving Havana. In fact, he's the captain of the Silver Fleet. We only found this solution to know where the treasure is.",
"Did you question him?",
"Not, yet. We prefer you do this.",
"I'll do it but his absence in Havana will alarm the authorities. We won't have much time to get the information.",
"Done! He understood I didn't feel like joking and he told where the treasure is.",
"In the ships?",
"No, it's in the El Morro fort.",
"Not better than the ships.",
"Worse, I would say. That's the reason they let it there during the stay.",
"Do you mean we must give up?",
"No, I don't. We'll attack the fort.",
"Are you sure we'll be able? You've just implied the fort is a big challenge.",
"Yes, but that isn't impossible. With a good plan, we can do it. The only problem is to prepare it as fast as possible. Tomorrow at night, we must act. Rest until tomorrow at noon, I'll call you for explaining the plan.",
"Gentlemen, I've got some work for you!",
"Is the plan ready?",
"Yes, we'll attack the fort by two sides. I'll command the troops in front of the main entry. My goal will be to attract the guards' attention. In the meantime, you and Elting with some of your crewmembers will penetrate into the fort by the opposite side to fight them on their back.",
"*Amazed tone* Captain, there is a cliff on that side.",
"I know. You'll approach the cliff with a small ship so as not to be detected by the guards. Arrived at the bottom of the cliff, you'll climb it thanks to the grapnels. The guards won't expect the enemy can come from that side.",
"I understand them.",
"Of course, it's dangerous but I have no other plan. If we want to win the battle we must surprise them. Otherwise, we'll have no chance.",
"Alright, we'll do at best.",
"Thank you, I knew I can count on you. Be confident, we'll succeed.",
"Elting?! That's you who destroyed the cannons?",
"Yes, Captain. Bartolomeu told me you were stopped by the cannons. But, no time for chatter, the Spanish must prepare a sortie. You should attack the fort!",
"I'm going right now to the main entrance. In the meantime, join Bartolomeu.",
"Well done! Now this floor is 'clean' we can go to the warehouse.",
"Look! The Aztec throne is here.",
"It's the throne I saw in the Vera Cruz fort.",
"It must be worth a fortune and we haven't still seen what the boxes hold. Let's quickly carry the treasure to the beach. The Havana' soldiers must be warned of our attack.",
"Alright, we've almost finished the loading. After joining our ships, we'll head for #sRedmond#.",
"I succeeded in selling most of the loot but there is a problem...",
"What do you mean?",
"The Aztec throne is too valuable to be sold in the Caribbean. The shopkeeper of #sRedmond# was our unique possibility but he doesn't have enough money for that.",
"What will we do now?",
"In my opinion, it must be sold to a rich jeweller of London. Only those people could pay us the right price.",
"So, we should go to England?",
"Unnecessary. The Governor could send it to England in one of his warships. We'll get the money when the warship comes back.",
"Of course, we'll have to pay the Governor for the 'service'...",
"Indeed. I still need to talk to him but I bet a quarter of the sale.",
"humm...",
"I think it's the best solution. The throne will be safer in a British warship and we don't need to waste our time going to England. Do you agree?",
"I agree. What does Elting think?",
"I'm going to speak with him. If he agrees, I'll talk to the Governor.",
"Good news! The Governor has one of his warships that must go to England next month.",
"And the price for the service?",
"At the beginning, he wanted a third of the sale but I persuaded him to lower his part to a quarter.",
"As you thought.",
"Yes. Now, we must wait six months or more to receive the money. Until there, we can waste the money given by the shopkeeper.",
"How much?",
"450 000 gold coins. So, 150 000 for each one. Take your money!",
"Not bad.",
"And it's just the beginning because the throne is worth more than this amount. I expect 250 000 for each one when sold.",
"God! That's a big sum!",
"Yes, Captain. But, there is much to wait until we receive the money.",
"In the meantime, what will you do?",
"I'll rest in #sRedmond# these next weeks. Afterwards, I don't know... I don't have any new expeditions scheduled.",
"In this case, I'll see you in half-an-year for the loot sharing.",
"Thanks for all Captain. Good luck!",
"Goodbye!",
