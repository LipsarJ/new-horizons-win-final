"Hmm, what's your problem, ",
"? Who is after your head?",
"What?",
"Hello. Who are you?",
"I'm ",
". And I'm in need of your help.",
"Sorry, I'm mistaken.",
"So, you are in need of my help again?",
"That's the pirate life...",
"Thank goodness, no. Such help is too expensive.",
"So you are in trouble with the pirates?",
"Indeed. I'd like to normalize the relations with my brethren of the coast.",
"Spain.",
"Portugal.",
"Holland.",
"France.",
"I just changed my mind.",
"Do you need to make peace with our community?",
"I'm afraid I don't understand.",
"Perhaps you'd be interested in my services?",
"I don't know, what do you have to offer?",
"I help people settle their problems.",
"Such as?",
"Well... Let's say, during your voyages, you partake of a few fat pirate ships. Before you know it, the whole pirate community is after your head, and life becomes difficult. If you come to me, I can help restore relations between you and pirates.\nOf course, this service does not come easily, and for me to arrange such things can cost a considerable amount. But you'll be able to visit pirate ports and towns and trade there again..",
"What guarantees do you provide that my 'relations' would be restored?",
"I'm the governor of #sTortuga#. My decisions are respected.",
"All right, I'd like to use your services.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"This is too much for me. Goodbye!",
"Deal. That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"Excuse me, you don't have enough gold. No deal.",
"Argh! Perhaps I'll return when I have more to offer.",
"You can set sail now. Everything will be settled as soon as possible.",
"Thank you. Take care.",
"That's not all.",
"Captain Bartolomeu, himself?!",
"Nice to meet you, Governor.",
"What brings one of the most famous pirates to this island?",
"I'd like to know if you are preparing a new expedition with the Brethren of the Coast.",
"Let's say there is a possibility that this will happen.",
"What do you mean?",
"I need more information before starting a new expedition.",
"What kind of information?",
"Let me explain. The paymaster of #sisland_Isla Muelle# has been replaced by a new employee. He left #sIsla Muelle# two months ago, to sail home to Spain.",
"So?",
"Well, the galleon carrying him was boarded shortly after sailing, by an English Navy ship. Seeing the former paymaster of #sisland_Isla Muelle# is an important figure to the Spanish Crown, the English captured and took him to Antigua.",
"I suppose they want a ransom for his release.",
"Right.",
"And your idea is to kidnap this Spaniard in order to negotiate the ransom instead of the English.",
"The idea is to kidnap the paymaster but not for a mere ransom.",
"What? Now, I don't understand.",
"A ransom would be nothing compared with the real goal.",
"The real goal?",
"Yes. Unknown to the English, I discovered that the governor of #sIsla Muelle# moved the gold reserves of the island around six months ago. They used to be held secure in the #sIsla Muelle# fort.",
"Why did he move the gold, it would have been risky?",
"The Governor thought the Dutch with the help of some corsairs were preparing an attack to the town.",
"But you don't know where the gold reserves are now?",
"Indeed. However, I think the former paymaster knows where they are.",
"Are the gold reserves considerable?",
"Yes. The gold comes from the American continent and it's stocked before being transported to Spain once each year. Soon, only in a couple of months, the fleet will take the gold.",
"That's REALLY interesting!",
"I know what you have done against the Spaniards in the past. Your experience would be valuable for this operation. So, if you want to participate in the expedition, I need your help to kidnap the kidnapped paymaster.",
"Is he still in Antigua?",
"Yes.",
"In the jail I suppose.",
"No. Someone with this rank is not guarded in a prison. I am told that he is locked up in the Port Admiral's residence.",
"Well... I just need to go there and collect him.",
"Yes, but you'll have a partner during the mission : Captain Daniel Montbars. He also wants to participate in this expedition.",
"Captain Montbars nicknamed the Exterminator?",
"Yes, the French pirate Captain. You have any reservations about his inclusion?",
"No, Governor. But, I could make the mission alone.",
"Unnecessary. Captain Montbars will be very useful to protect you during the mission.",
"Alright. Can I go now?",
"Yes. Captain Montbars will see you on the dock. Remember, nothing must happen to the paymaster. The entire plan depends on him.",
"Don't worry, Governor.",
"Congratulations, You've got him!",
"Indeed. What are we going to do?",
"Take him outside the town! I need to interrogate him in private.",
"He said he doesn't know where the gold is hidden.",
"He lies. But how to force him to give the information?",
"Alright, we know enough. Our prisoner will stay in jail until we have the gold. Captain Montbars and you follow me to my residence.",
"Captains Bartolomeu and Montbars, we need to prepare a fleet. Seeing the Aguadilla fort hasn't got as many cannons as #sIsla Muelle#, we'll attack by sea. At the moment, the fleet is only composed of three ships...",
"Two, you mean. Mine and the Montbars one.",
"No, three. My officer, Captain Arnaud Fontaines, will accompany you. However there is a lot of guards inside the fort, we should add at least one ship to the fleet. Any suggestion?",
"Can I propose Roxanne Lalliere?",
"Roxanne Lalliere? She's a good captain, I don't have any objections. What do you think Captain Montbars?",
"Alright, let's include her. Do you know where she is?",
"At #sFalaise De Fleur#. She works for the French Governor.",
"Well. The fleet will go to #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# before attacking the Spanish fort.",
"And what about the gold if we succeed in this task?",
"Don't worry, the gold will be fairly shared here, in #sTortuga#.",
"I trust you, Governor.",
"Well, meet my captain in the port and see Roxanne on #sisland_Falaise De Fleur#. Good luck!",
"See you soon, Governor.",
"......",
"Finally, it is good to see that you made it back in one piece! But where is Captain Montbars?",
"That's the problem, Governor. We seized the fort in #sisland_Isla Muelle# and found the gold... However, Captain Montbars took advantage of an explosion to attack me and escape with all the gold.",
"What?! Son of a Snake - Montbars! If he thinks he can ridicule the Brethren of the Coast, he's made a big mistake!",
"We don't know where he is. Can you help us?",
"His last stay was in #sTortuga#. I don't really know where he could be at the moment... After what he did, it would be too dangerous for him to live on a pirate island. Obviously, same goes for a Spanish island and even for a French one. With the relationships I have with the other French Governors, it would be easy for me to arrest him.",
"We can also exclude the Portuguese colony of #sisland_Conceicao#. He must know the Portuguese Governor is my friend.",
"So, only remain the English and Dutch islands.",
"I think so. Seeing #sisland_Aruba# has been a Spanish colony for some months, we have the towns of Philipsburg, Charlestown, Alice and the islands of #sisland_Cayman#, #sisland_Redmond#, #sisland_Douwesen#, #sisland_Curacao#, #sisland_Oxbay# and #sisland_Antigua#.",
"A lot of locations.",
"Yes, Governor. But seeing, we are three captains, we can divide the search between us. I could look for him in Alice town, #sisland_Cayman# and #sisland_Redmond#.",
"You're right, Captain. That's the best way of finding him. You can immediately start your search. I'm going to share the rest of the tasks between Captain Fontaines and Captain Lalliere.",
"See you, Governor.",
"Captain Bartolomeu! Good to see you. Tell me you found the gold, you are our last hope.",
"You're last hope?",
"Yes, Captain Fontaines and Lalliere have already returned to #sTortuga# and they didn't find any clues.",
"Well, the good news is I found him and the gold. But I also have bad news, I only found a small part of what was taken.",
"What bad luck! Any ideas about the rest?",
"Not really, Governor. I found Montbars alone in the Cayman jungle and he refused to tell me where the gold was. Fortunately, I found a map of a secret island where the gold was stocked. However, nothing was there.",
"Annoying...",
"I can only make some suppositions like the crew left him and took the rest or the biggest part is hidden in another place.",
"Humm... I think we can forget that gold. It would be easier to find a needle in a hay stack.",
"What are we going to do?",
"Unload the gold you have. I'm going to call Captain Lalliere and Fontaines for the share-out.",
"Your cargo of gold is estimated at 240 000 gold coins.",
"Not bad, Governor. However, I only recovered fifteen or twenty percent of the gold stolen in the fort. I assess the entire loot at one million gold coins.",
"An unbelievable sum, of course. Unfortunately, the death of Montbars didn't bring back all of the gold. If we share the loot in three parts, each one will have 80 000 gold coins. Do we agree?",
"Agreed.",
"Good, take your part. In the short-term I have no future expeditions, so good hunting Captain Bartolomeu at least for the next few months.",
"Thank-you and Goodbye, Governor.",
