"Who are you? Who invited you into my house, you have made one big mistake?",
"Nobody. Are you Charles Baxter?",
"Yes, I am. You haven't answered my questions.",
"I don't care for your questions. I came to get justice for the murder of a friend a few days ago.",
"HA-HA! Are you foolish?! Do you think I'm just an average Joe?! I'm one of the most famous pirates in the Caribbean.",
"Really?! For me, you are but the lint in the belly button of a snake. If you still call yourself a man, accept a duel outside where all can see!",
"You broke into my house, you challenged me to a duel and I don't even know your name. However, in a few minutes, no-one will care, your corpse will serve as food for the ants.",
"Cut the chatter, show me how well you fight.",
"Arrggg....",
"Finally you can stand up! Do you think that I'd carry you to the Pirate Settlement.",
"What happened? I passed out?",
"Indeed. After all, you are not so skilful in dueling.",
"Go on! Take me for a ride. Where are my weapons?",
"Lost in the jungle. Of course, I won't give you weapons.",
"Why did you not kill me when you had the chance?",
"It was not my intention to kill you at all.",
"What do you mean? You said you wanted to avenge the death of that man I killed a few days ago.",
"All true! But it was not the only reason to arrest you. I won't say anymore else about this. Follow me, my crew is waiting for us at the Pirate Settlement Port.",
"No, I will stay here.",
"Know this , bastard, I won't hesitate to kill you if you don't obey me!",
"Alright. For now, you have the advantage over me.",
"That's better.",
"YOUR SHIP?!",
"That's life! One day you are captain, next day you are nothing. Board the ship! We have a long voyage in front of us.",
"This was your mission : hand over me to the Portuguese Governor. I should have let my men kill you instead of accepting a duel!",
"Right, but it's too late. Soon, you will be at the end of a rope.",
"I will meet you again.",
"I don't think so. I'm not used to meeting dead men.",
