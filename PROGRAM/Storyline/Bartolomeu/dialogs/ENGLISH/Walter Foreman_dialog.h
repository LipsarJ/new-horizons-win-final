"Hello, Captain!",
"I know you. You were in the Residence.",
"Right. I'm working for Gilroy.",
"What do you want exactly? Your Chief decided to tell me where Charles is?",
"No, he won't tell you, you're dreaming. But me, you could have more chance, savvy?",
"You seem to be smarter. What do you want in exchange of the information.",
"Gold, of course. In fact, 4,000 gold coins.",
"What?! 4,000 for a small piece of information? I think you're dreaming, not me.",
"As you like, Matey. Have a good day!",
"Wait! We can discuss the sum, can't we?",
"No. I don't know why you want to meet Charles. But I know I will be in trouble if my Boss finds out I gave away this information. So, I won't sell it for any less.",
"Ok, I accept. Here's the money.",
"Ok, I accept but give me more time to find the money.",
"Alright, come back here with the money next time.",
"I'll do that.",
"Thanks! It's a pleasure dealing with you.",
"Maybe. Now, I want the information.",
"Of course. At the moment, you can find Charles at #sCharlestown#.",
"#sCharlestown#?! What does he do there?",
"It's a safe place for him. He corrupted the Governor. So he can calmly live there.",
"This pirate has no limits.",
"Indeed. Well, it would be suspicious to stay here with you any longer. My Boss has friends everywhere on this island, so Goodbye Matey!",
"Wait! What guarantees I have this information is true.",
"I told you what I know. My chief has the same information as you. So, if you don't believe me, that's your problem!",
"Alright. Let's hope I'll find Charles in #sCharlestown#.",
"Have you got the money?",
"Yes, take it!",
