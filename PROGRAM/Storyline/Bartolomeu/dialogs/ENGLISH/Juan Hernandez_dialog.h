"Hello, sir.",
"Can I ask you a question? I'm looking for a man called Emilio Soares. Have you seen him?",
"Perhaps. Who are you?",
"I am ",
"and my friend here is William Klein.",
"Bartolomeu? You're Emilio's captain, aren't you?",
"So you do know Emilio!",
"Indeed, yes. I'm sorry for being so cautious. Emilio arrived here a couple of days ago after spending several weeks in the jungle, trying to find the city. He isn't very used to being on land.",
"So where is he now? Did he manage to find a ship to take him away from here?",
"No, he didn't. There aren't many ships that sail to #sRedmond# from here, considering that the Spanish are at war with the English. Emilio insisted on either finding a ship to #sRedmond# or staying here. He usually resides at my house, but at the moment he's taking a stroll outside the city. It is risky, considering he is wanted by the authorities, but I couldn't stop him from going.",
"Thanks for helping us find him. And also a major thanks for helping Emilio.",
"I don't like the government much, so I'm happy for every opportunity to help pirates and smugglers alike.",
"That is very good of you. Thanks a lot.",
