"Captain Elting? What are you doing here?",
"Can you explain, Elting, who are these people accompanying you?",
"Let me tell you : I'm Bartolomeu o Portugues and this woman is Roxanne Lalliere.",
"What are you doing out in the jungle? You should have been in a jail like Roxanne!",
"That's life. There has been a small change in the plan. Now, Captain Elting is with us.",
"I knew we couldn't count on a Dutchman to be loyal. All traitors!",
"*ironic tone* Don't be so nasty. I suppose you won't let us go to Alice town.",
"*ironic tone* Must I answer you?",
"I don't think so. Let our weapons do that instead.",
"Stop! What are you doing here?",
"We are trying to find a comfortable patch of soft grass to roll around on.... some privacy would be appreciated..",
"Near a military area at this hour, I don't believe you. I arrest you both, we can sort out the truth of it later.",
"What? Are you crazy?!",
"Crazy!!! Insulting an officer of the Spanish crown is an offence, you are only making it worse for yourselves.",
"I don't care if you think I insulted you. Nobody arrests Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"Bartolomeu? The pirate?",
"Of course, the pirate. What were you thinking?",
"You came to release Roxanne Lalliere just as Vice-Admiral Benavides predicted. By the way, I bet Roxanne is the woman accompanying you.",
"Yes, Roxanne in all her glory. I know you were preparing a trap to arrest me. Elting already explained this.",
"And, where is Elting?",
"He's sleeping in the prison... an eternal sleep.",
"Bastard! The time has come for you and your friend to die.",
"You are not the first to say this and you won't be the last.",
"Son of a toad, I'll soon prove you wrong...",
