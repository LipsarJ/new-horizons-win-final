"Off with you! I'm in no mood to talk to strangers.",
"Don't you want to buy me some rum?",
"On your way. I'm busy.",
"...",
"What?",
"I'm looking for a man named ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
". He's a captain. Have you seen him?",
"Yes! Yes! I've seen `im with my own eyes! But you'd do better to ask that innkeeper woman - she knows him far better than I do. If you take my meaning, sir.",
"I see. Thanks.",
"Of all the ",
" people on this island, I had to run into you...",
"Hold there, friend. I only need some information on your fair colony here. There might be some rum in it for ya, if you're helpful-like.",
"*sigh* Fine, ask away -- but be quick with it.",
"Hurry it up -- I got some fine grog, fair booty an' adequate wenches waitin' in me cabin.",
"Better get on quick-like, before me rum-fired good cheer wears off.",
"Small as your village is, I still need some directions.",
"Just need to get my bearings is all.",
"Would ye be so kind as to tell me where to find...",
"What can you tell me about this illustrious and wholly legitimate colony of yours?",
"One of your lovely citizens interests me...",
"I came here to find out about someone in town.",
"Be a dear and tell me about someone? Might be a mate of yours.",
"Ugh, I can almost see a corona of stink lines to go with that pocky smell of yers. Nevermind.",
"Who ya got in mind there, eh luv? *scratch*",
"eh? *fart*",
"Why, all mates of mine, they is -- every bleedin' last one of these scoundrels, ha! *burp*",
"Who governs you unruly lot?",
"Your ale-dispenser, barwench, whatever you like to call her.",
"That gentleman who portends to repair seagoing vessels -- oh I'm sorry, are my words too big for ya?",
"He who sells the sails and, uh, stuff.",
"That weasely, wall-eyed tinsmith outside of town.",
"The miss who governs the brothel...",
"Nevermind; no one's worth knowing about on this rock. But I'd like to know something else.",
"Arne? Even for a pirate, that lad is crooked. Plus he was always makin' a foul racket, when he had his shop here behind the stakes -- so we kindly provided him a new shop, OUTSIDE.",
"Very well. Another thing...",
"Thankee, that's all.",
"Eugene Martin? He is not really our Boss but a lot of people work for him. He lives in the stonehouse near the gates of this Camp.",
"I shall have to pay him a visit. But about another matter...",
"Thanks. So long.",
"Good Florentin! He takes fine care of us rowdy boys. Knows how to dispense wit' what pleases us, like.",
"Sorry to keep you, but there's another thing...",
"Aye, Benoit Bertignac. Just moved to #sPort au Prince# not too long ago. He does a fair job fixin' boats, plus he has a score to sell.",
"Good. Something else?",
"Ha, that'd be Eugene Martin. He'll cheat ya crooked if he can... and that's as good as ye get even if he likes ya.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Good to hear. Cheerio.",
"Heh, I see where yer going with this -- followin' yer bowspirit into a friendly port, eh mate, huh, eh? A little of the ol' nudge-nudge, wink-wink, eh friend? heh... Anyway, Celestine -- for that's the 'spectable mistruss's name -- keeps a fine stable o' pretty mares, she does. I think you'll enjoy a visit.",
"Spot-on. Will you bear one question more?",
"Right, what now?",
"I know this island better'n anyone, so yer best to ask me.",
"Knows this place wells, me do. But yer about to know me boot e'en bet'r if ye keeps flappin' on overlongs-like... mate.",
"Oi, I'd sell my ship, my dear mum AND my soul if I could only get a drink...",
"A fine set o' leaks brought me here -- who can set me up with a ship to fill the gaps?",
"Got a merchant here who AIN'T a cheat?",
"Can anyone on this wretched rock mend my bloody sword?",
"A fellow's got needs... if you catch my drift. Where might they be met?",
"What? I have no idea where you can find a Blacksmith.",
"I'll take my chances, thankee.",
"And your poor excuse for a shipyard?",
"Who'll buy the old crap out of my hold?",
"Florentin' got a tankard waitin' for you on the near side of the trolley what is in the back of town.",
"Much obliged, my rude, smelly friend.",
"And where might I have my ship repaired?",
"Supposin' I want to deal in some com-PLETE-ly legal trade?",
"My blade's near to rusting away to naught... can somebody in this town patch it up?",
"There is no shipyard here Matey! You need to go to #sPort au Prince#!",
"But more importantly -- where's your ale-house?",
"I need to find someone who'll give me a fair price for my goods.",
"You've been most helpful; that's all.",
"Who serves as blacksmith to you lot?",
"Talk to Eugene Martin. His house is the first one on your right when you enter the Camp.",
"Where's your shipyard?",
"How about the tavern?",
"That's all I can stand of your company, thanks.",
"And what if I were to tell you my sword's not sharp enough to split open a ripe melon?",
"I'm not sure I follow, friend...",
"You know -- certain needs, that a man posesses from time to time... A man long at sea, with only the company of his mates, who, pretty as some may be, don't go a long way in quenching certain fires that burn in his loins?",
"Wot's that? Burnin' loins? I think I might have some ointment here, if that's what you're after... I don't see what else you might be meanin'...",
"Let me spell it out for you, MATE: Where do ye keep yer blasted whores?!",
"Me horse? Why, he's back home in his stable, all munchin' nice-like on hay and oats, fat and pretty as y'please. I don't see what that's got to do with burning loins, however.",
"*sigh* Forget it... looks like it's back to spankin' the plank for this lonely sailor.",
"By the by, cap'n, just between the two of us: 'S no ointment or equestrian persuits there, but ye might like to drop by the brothel far side of the boulder, right beside our guv'nor's home. They host a mighty nice game o' dice there. And tell little Lucie a right hello for me, if ye would... *blush... belch*",
"*sigh*",
"Us fellows of low morale fibre are a patient lot -- up to a point. (A sharp and steely point, y'see.) Be quick about it.",
"Right, anything you wanna know -- 'ceptin' where I keeps me stash.",
"Really that in'erested, huh? Most visitors here just kinda cut an' run, if ye ken...",
"I'd like to know the history of this Camp -- much storied, to be sure.",
"What's to be found on this desolate rock besides your village?",
"No, rather, another topic will do, shall we?",
"Aye, storied she is: a fine 'istory o' blood an' guts. But we freebootin', seafarin' folk -- calls ourselves 'Buccaneer Caribbeans', if it please ye -- take good care of our own sort, and as long as ye be flyin' the skull'n'bones, yer a mate of ours. Why, there's ",
"Fascinating... do oblige and tell me more.",
"Perfectly intruiging. But I've other things on my mind just now.",
"The Buccaneers' Camp has been existing for fifty years. Many times the Spaniards have tried to expel us from here and they've always failed. And let 'em try, says I!",
"Quite a story indeed. I'd like to know more about the present state of things, now.",
"Nope, 't'ain't naught else to be found here... just our little settlement, to be sure. And I'd be careful, askin' about our private affairs here, mark my words.",
"Hmhm... duly noted. Anything more you know about your island?",
"Well... far side of the island, through some jungly-bits, ye just might stumble on a nice surprise. But I'll keep mum about it for now.",
"How lovely. I should like to know more, if you'll bear with me.",
"Y'din't hear this from me, but... Quite a pretty mansion, there is, just through a spot of jungle yonder. Been deserted these many years, even full of swag as she is, but we're all a'feared to touch it, 'lessen the owner should decide to come back -- a right fearful one that is, we all think.",
"Oh yeah?",
"You've been unexpectedly, but delightfully, helpful. Could you answer me another one, mate?",
".",
" of us now!",
