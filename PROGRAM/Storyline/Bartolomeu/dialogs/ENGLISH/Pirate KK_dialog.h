"Oohhh... My head!",
"What happened? Are you alright?",
"You're not Spaniard?! Who are you? What are you doing here on this island?",
"Don't worry! We are not Spaniards. We're looking for a mine. There should be a silver mine on #sisland_Battle Rocks#.",
"Yes, you're right, but how did you find out? The Spaniards make sure that this information is a complete secret.",
"It seems they failed. And you? Are you also looking for the mine?",
"That damned mine! It has been the origin of my misfortune! I almost lost my life there...",
"Could you explain that a bit more, I do not quite understand?",
"Well, the Spaniards found the mine two years ago. Of course, the mine belonged to the indians before that. Since then, the Spaniards deported dozens of prisoners from their colonies to work as slave labour. Their fate is to work and die here. And believe me that only a few months of this life is enough to kill them.",
"So, you escaped from the Spaniards.",
"Indeed, last night. But they were not my only problem. I met a group of indians a short time after and only just managed to escape them, they did wound me, though.",
"Humm...That might be the group we fought a short time ago. Could you take us to the mine?",
"Do you really want to go there? The mine is well-defended by a military camp. They have many soldiers.",
"Ok, I agree to take you there but on one condition... that you release my friends in the mine.",
"Of course, we would have done this anyway.",
"In that case, follow me!",
"Very odd! I expected more soldiers in the camp.",
"All the more reason to be careful. Tell me, where is the mine, we should release your friends while there are so few enemies about.",
"It's near the camp. Follow me again!",
"Who are you! What are you doing here! Your name now!",
"My name is: GO TO HELL!",
"Hey! Konrad Kulczycki is back! Did you come to release us?",
"Aye! Your days of working this mine are over. But, where are the rest of the prisoners...",
"They were taken to the port by the Spanish soldiers.",
"Port? What port?",
"The only port - where the silver is loaded aboard the ships of course.",
"What?! There is a silver train heading to the port, now?",
"Yes, they left the camp one hour ago.", 
"Now I understand why there were so few soldiers. Well, you and your companions go to the shore on the East coast. I'm going to try to catch up with the train.",
"Wait Captain! I know a shortcut through the jungle to reach the port. It's still possible to catch them before they reach the port.",
"Excellent! Let's go.",
"Thank God! Finally, we are free! I knew that Konrad Kulczycki would help us after escaping from the camp.",
"Indeed, your nightmare here has ended. But we are not yet free, we need to leave this island. More Spaniards can come at any time.",
"Thank you for everything! I will never forget what you did for me and my friends.",
"It was a pleasure. This gold will be a good start for a new career. See you Konrad Kulczycki!",
