"What are you doing in my house, stranger?",
"The innkeeper told me you live here. I wanted to speak with you.",
"Why?",
"Let's say I have a deal to propose. In exchange of information, I will give you some gold coins.",
"I don't understand. Why do you want the help of a cook? You don't seem to be a cook or anyone interested in learning the cooking.",
"Ha! Ha! not really. I'm interested in your services because you work in the fort.",
"So, what?",
"I knew the authorities found near the town some valuable objects. I just want to know if they are stocked in the fort at the moment.",
"I don't know what the authorities can have in the fort or not; ask them.",
"It would be dangerous for me to ask this kind of thing without forgetting this information must remain confidential.",
"Humm... You're a thief aren't you? Sorry, but I don't want to be in trouble. Ask someone else for this work. Bye!",
"Wait! I'll be generous if you work for me. You mustn't earn much as cook?",
"Indeed. But, at least, I avoid any trouble.",
"How many months do you need to work for earning 1000 gold coins?",
"Six months. It's the money you want to give me?",
"Yes. As I said, I'll pay well if you help me. It won't be dangerous for you to obtain the information.",
"How can you be sure?",
"As cook, you see the soldiers many times in the day. You just need to listen to their talks over the next days. You would have to hear something about an Aztec treasure.",
"A treasure?!",
"Yes, the authorities would have found an Aztec treasure near Vera Cruz. However, I need a confirmation and if it is stocked in the warehouse.",
"Humm... For 1000 gold coins, I can try. But, don't think I'll put my life in risk.",
"Of course... I give you three days. I'll be in a safe place near the town.",
"Very well.",
"Just another thing. Don't try to denounce me to the authorities because even if they arrest me, be sure it won't be lacking people to avenge me.",
"Alright, alright... Don't worry, I don't want to be a hero. There are a lot in the cemeteries.",
"Good, you seem to be smart. See you soon!",
"Already back?",
"Of course, I said you had three days not three weeks. Any news about the treasure?",
"I think you are wrong there is no treasure in the warehouse or anywhere else in the fort.",
"What? It would already have been here. How do you know it isn't here?",
"I listened to the soldiers during the meals and they never talked about a treasure or even anything of valuable stocked in the fort.",
"Maybe, they've got instructions so as not to talk about that...",
"I don't think so because I went near the fort's warehouse and I didn't see it was better guarded. I suppose a treasure so valuable would have a better protection than the usual.",
"Now, you're right. It would be better protected. So, there are two hypothesis. The first one, the treasure doesn't exist and I'm wasting time and money. The second one, it is stocked outside the town but where?",
"You give up?",
"No, if it's the second hypothesis, the treasure will have to come to Vera Cruz to be loaded in the Silver Fleet. So, during at least a few days, it will have to stay in the fort.",
"But the Silver Fleet won't come before two months... And everyone knows that in the town.",
"That's the problem but I can't leave the town before being sure the treasure doesn't exist.",
"As you like, but I did my work so I deserve the reward.",
"I'll give it when the treasure arrives or I'm sure the treasure doesn't exist.",
"Eh! That's not fair. It's not my fault if the treasure is not here.",
"I give you half of the reward now and I'll pay the rest at the end of the operation.",
"I don't agree. Don't count on me in the future if you need my services.",
"Damn it! Take the money, you're more annoying than a married woman! If you have more news over the next days, go to the tavern I or my officer will be there.",
"I've got some news!",
"Let's go outside. There are too many ears in this place.",
"You were right, I think the treasure exists. An officer came to talk to the captain of the fort. I knew a valuable cargo will arrive over the next days.",
"You only heard the words 'valuable cargo' not treasure.",
"Yes. But, there is a strong possibilty it's the treasure.",
"Maybe. Do you know the right day of its arrival?",
"No, unfortunately.",
"Humm.. Alright, I'll wait. If you've got more information, tell me. Maybe, I can see the treasure just before entering the fort.",
"I'll do...(he holds out one's hand)",
"What?",
"My money.",
"What money? I already paid you the last time for almost nothing. Now, you didn't confirmed it was the treasure they were talking about and you want more money?",
"You know like me it must be the treasure otherwise you wouldn't want to wait. I deserve 500 gold coins or I won't inform you anymore.",
"Take the money! I hope for you they were talking about the treasure.",
"Ha! Finally, here you are!",
"Emilio said you wanted to speak with me as soon as possible.",
"Yes, Captain. The treasure arrived!",
"Great! When?",
"During the night, I only knew that this morning. I also learnt it should have been here for almost two months. But, I have no idea why this happened.",
"Humm... I bet it was not by chance it arrived at night. They wanted a discreet arrival. Did you see the treasure?",
"No. Anyway, it would have been impossible. The treasure entered the fort by a door looking outside, towards a road through the jungle. And from now on, the warehouse is guarded by too many soldiers. I can't approach it.",
"Alright, I know enough. Now, it's my turn to deal with the treasure. I suppose you want a new reward for your last news.",
"Of course. 500 gold coins is the price.",
"Take this. I think I won't need your services before long.",
"Damn it! You're more annoying than a married woman! At the moment, I don't have this sum with me. I saw a merchant in the Vera Cruz' square, I'm going to sell him some items and I'll come back to pay you.",
"Have you got my money?",
"Yes, take it! If you have more news over the next days, go to the tavern I or my officer will be there.",
"I don't have the money. Wait again, I'll be back soon.",
