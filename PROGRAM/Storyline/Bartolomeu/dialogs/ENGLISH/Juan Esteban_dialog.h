"Finally, here you are!",
"Who are you?",
"I'm Juan Esteban, officer of his majesty King Felipe IV.",
"Don't tell me you came to kill me. I'm quite tired of killing Spaniards.",
"*ironic tone* What a pity! But the Spanish authorities are also tired of you.",
"Don't think I'll apologize for my behaviour to your so called authorities.",
"I'm not surprised. So, I challenge you to a duel, it will resolve this situation.",
"Well, well, well.... Have I a choice?",
"No, of course not, idiot.",
"I guessed it, fool. En garde!",
"You won the duel. Kill me if you want!",
"You are a brave and good fighter, I won't kill you. I would like you to be my officer!",
"Working for pirates? That's impossible!",
"You shouldn't waste your time working for the Spanish authorities. You earn but a miserable pay, for the risks you take. I'm a generous captain, join me. I reward loyalty and courage with gold.",
"Humm... Can I trust you?",
"Talk to my officers, they will confirm what I said.",
"After all, you did not kill me, so I trust you. I'm not against the idea of changing my life. Being an Officer of the Spanish crown is becoming very dangerous and I have no family left in Spain.",
"Excellent Juan! From now on, you work for me. Let's go, we have a lot to do.",
"You're right. Maybe that wouldn't be a good decision for you.",
"So, I can leave, just like that, you do amaze me, Captain?",
"Of course, Good bye Esteban!", 
"Captain? You here!? Don't speak with me, that would be too dangerous for us.",
"Sorry. I'll never do it again.",
