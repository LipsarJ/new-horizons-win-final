"Captain Bartolomeu, I've heard a lot of your feats.",
"Thank you, Captain Montbars. Your reputation is also known throughout the archipelago.",
"So, we are partners according to Governor Ogeron.", 
"Yes. I'm interested in that story of gold reserves on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"HA-HA! What pirate wouldn't be interested in gold?!",
"You're right. Otherwise, do you know our mission Captain Montbars?",
"Yes. We have to kidnap a former Spanish paymaster held in the British Naval Base of Antigua.",
"Indeed. I think one way of doing this is by infiltrating the town at night, when all is quiet.",
"The only way, I agree, seeing the town is full of soldiers by day, but still not without risk at night.",
"No risk - no gain. Let's go, Captain. We can't allow the paymaster to be released before our 'rescue'.",
"Here we are! And now Captain?",
"Of course, we can't enter the town by the gates. Too dangerous...",
"I know a way that is safe.",
"How?",
"There is an underground passage near the waterfall that leads to the town center.",
"Excellent.",
"However, it's used as hiding place by the bandits of the island.",
"Not a problem. I think we can deal with them.",
"Alright, let's go then.",
"Follow me, Captain. We are near the passage.",
"This is the entry, let's go in.",
"I'll go alone.",
"What?",
"It is better that I accomplish this part of the mission alone, two will be noticed where one may not.",
"Are you sure, Captain?",
"Yes, believe me. Stay here and protect the entry. If I'm not back here within an hour, come and get me.",
"As you like.",
"Damn it! A patrol is coming.",
"We have no choice. Let's fight them!",
"Congratulations Captain, you released the Spaniard. However, the game is up - we need to get off Antigua now.",
"Yes, we are in danger. Let's return to our ships and head to #sTortuga#.",
"We should torture him instead of interrogating. We are only losing our time!",
"I don't agree. He could die if we torture him.",
"I've got an idea.",
"Humm.. Agree to Roxanne, even if I think we could do it without any further help.",
"Roxanne's ship is in port.",
"She must be somewhere around the town. Let's start the search.",
"All the cannons are destroyed.",
"The fort cannons, yes. But, we aren't yet safe. A small Spanish company has just placed a field cannon on the other side of the beach... Maybe Captain Fontaines can hit it from his ship.",
"Maybe. But, a quick attack on that cannon can prevent many deaths on our side.",
"You're right. Don't let them target you, move quickly and not in a straight line. Let's go!",
"MOOOVVEEE!!!",
"Look at these boxes! there must be a fortune in gold. We are all RICH, very very RICH!",
"Fantastic, we will be rolling in it. However, before loading the boxes, we had better check that there are no other soldiers in or around the fort, we don't want to be caught with our pants down.",
"What? YOU HERE?!",
"Surprised, aren't you? Did you think I would just sit by and let you spend my share of gold without taking any action?",
"In the Caribbean, only the smartest will be rich.",
"For me, smart is not a synonym of treacherous. Where is the gold, scoundrel?",
"You're still naive. Do you think I'm going to tell you, just because you ask?",
"Maybe, you are willing to talk to my blade.",
"You need a good lesson in fencing.",
"As you say in your country : En garde!",
