"Captain Bartolomeu, I need to speak with you?",
"Do I know you?",
"I’m Serafino Masarenhas, the envoy of the Portuguese Governor. I was looking for you.",
"Looking for me? What do you want, Sir?",
"Governor Barreto wants to see you. He has a mission for you.",
"What mission?",
"I don’t know the details but it’s an important mission. The governor is counting on you to help him.",
"Alright, I can’t refuse him. I guess I have to go to #sConceicao# right now?",
"Sorry, but at the moment I’ve got other pressing plans. Tell him I can do nothing for him at the moment.",
"Yes, right now. I will accompany you during the voyage. Let’s go!",
"I’m disappointed by your answer but you have the right to refuse to help him. Goodbye Captain!",
"Goodbye!",
"Finally, we are at #sConceicao#. I'm going to inform the Governor of your arrival.",
"Excellent. I'll be there in a few minutes.",
