"Hello Captain! Nice to meet you.",
"Hello Captain Mansveldt. Your name is familiar.",
"Maybe you've heard someone talking of my expeditions. I've attacked the Spanish colonies many times and been very lucky with my efforts.",
"Of course, now I remember! You are referred as the pirate leader of #sisland_Redmond#, your fame has spread far and wide.",
"Indeed, but I'm an old pirate. And most probably, Captain Morgan will succeed me.",
"Of course, I understand.",
"Captain, it would be better to not waste time in idle chatter. Please go to your ship. We'll join you in due course.",
"Very well, I will see you on board.",
"Now, we know that the island is not deserted.",
"Yes and it is dangerous. We have to be on our guard. Keep your eyes open and weapons at hand, move on.",
"The port seems to be calm. Even the spanish fleut has no crew at the moment.",
"Really strange...The only thing we are sure of is that the silver train hasn't arrived yet...",
"The silver is loaded Captain.",
"Great! Let's sail for #sTortuga#. We have much business to do there.",
"Captain, I was pleased to work with you, another successful mission. Maybe we'll meet again..",
"Maybe. Goodbye Captain Mansveldt.",
