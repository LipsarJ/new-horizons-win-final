"So, you are the Roxanne's partner?",
"Yes, I am. And you're Francois l'Ollonais.",
"Himself. What's your name Captain? Roxanne didn't tell me.",
"I'm Jorge Coelho.",
"I haven't heard of a pirate with this name in the archipelago...",
"Because I've been here for only a very short while.",
"Humm.. Usually, I only choose experienced pirates as partner. I don't like this situation. However, I trust Roxanne and if she chooses you as a partner, then, OK.",
"And what are the terms of our deal?",
"If we find the idol, I want half of its sale price.",
"That's too much. We are three captains. That should be only a third.",
"I won't let an unexperienced captain earn as much as me. I think you dream. You don't seem to know who I am, captain. Anyway, you seem to be as one to me.",
"Fine, I accept a quarter. You should accept the offer too.",
"Alright, we have an accord.",
"That's more reasonable. But for the sale, we will must all agree about whom can buy it.",
"Why?",
"If the idol really has magical powers, we can't sell it to just anybody.",
"These magical powers are very likely a myth. I just hope the buyer will believe in them so that we can sell the statuette for a higher price.",
"We'll see. Now, all the details are resolved, could you tell us if you found any information about the idol?",
"No, none at the moment. I think only the governor and his most important officers are in possession of the information.",
"*Ironical tone* Don't tell me you think to interrogate the governor..",
"Not the governor but his right-hand man, the commander of the garrison, Luis Perdiguero.",
"This task is extremely dangerous.",
"I didn't say it wasn't. In fact, the commander lives in a building next to the Townhall. Our advantage is that he is not guarded by soldiers.",
"Yes, but there are always soldiers patrolling the Townhall Square.",
"Of course, but fewer during the night, and then it's easier for someone to sneak into the building.",
"If he is spotted, there is no possibility of escape.",
"I admit that. But, we don't have enough men to capture him by force. Remember, #sIsla Muelle# has one of the biggest garrisons of the archipelago.",
"Alright. Tell me how we will reach the Townhall' Square. The entire city is guarded by patrols.",
"Going through the town would be too dangerous, that's why my men will install a rope just behind the Church allowing the wall to be climbed. The distance between the Church and the building is short.",
"Well, it seems to be a good plan. Who will question the commander?",
"I can't deal with everything. So if you want to be my partners, show me you are willing to do this.",
"Seeing this question is solved, I'll wait for you tonight near the wall.",
"Alright.",
"The rope is installed, you just need to climb.",
"Don't worry, I must be quick getting the information, the longer I am in there the more dangerous it will be.",
"So, what happened?",
"First, contrary what you said, there was a guard in front of the commander's house. However, I got in and spoke to him and I've got the information. The idol is in the unexplored area of Curaçao.",
"Are you sure?",
"Yes, It is what he said. But we have to hurry because the governor has already sent a battleship there.. not forgetting about the guards that are coming now. I was seen after my little talk with the commander.",
"Our ships are anchored at Oyster beach. Let's go now, maybe we still have a chance of finding the statuette before them.",
"Indeed.",
"And now, Captain?",
"We need to know how to reach the area where the idol is. Let's start talking to the #sWillemstad#'s people.",
"We can't waste any more time. Let's go now.",
"Alright.",
"Unbelievable, There is a Spanish battleship grounded on the shore!",
"What?! I'm quite sure it's the ship the governor of #sisland_Isla Muelle# sent here.",
"It has to be the one. She must have been hit by a tornado. For this kind of ship, a simple storm can't cause a such damage.",
"You're right. Now, the Spaniards can't stop us from taking the statuette. Let's go on our search.",
"Dash it! The indians attacked from everywhere.",
"The Dariens I bet. We must be near their camp.",
"Yes?",
"Look! I think I found their temple or something similar. Just behind the trees, there is a door. Let's enter.",
"Wait! I will stay outside.",
"What are you talking about?! Are you afraid?",
"Are you joking, Captain? I'm François l'Ollonais. Did you forget?! No, I will stay here in order to repel any new attack from the indians. I wouldn't like to be trapped inside the temple.",
"As you like. I'm going to check if the idol is inside.",
"So?",
"YES! I've got it! ....but wait! who are these men with you?",
"Some crew members from my ship. I told them to follow us discreetly.",
"Why? I don't understand.",
"Well, Captain or I should call you Bartolomeu o Portugues.. Time has come to give me the idol.",
"How did you know my name?",
"I'm not entirely stupid. I didn't believe that fairy story that you were a pirate only recently arrived in the Caribbean. So, I asked my officer to obtain some information about you. He questioned one of your crew members, helped by some bottles of rum. And found out who you really were.",
"Dash it! I'd like to keel haul that crewmember.",
"That's not important... Now, give me the idol!",
"I don't think so.",
"If you give me the idol you'll live otherwise my men will kill you, your choice.",
"Take it, traitor!",
"Sorry, but I've better things to do now. So, it is goodbye... forever!",
"You are not very smart Captain. Do you think my captain would let you live, especially after what you did to his friend Charles Baxter.",
"I am a bit slow. It seems the Caribbean weather changes quickly.",
"Too late for you to find out now that you have been manipulated almost from when you arrived, you just never saw the big picture.",
"Talk to the hand, I have no words or mercy left!",
