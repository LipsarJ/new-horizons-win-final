title=Richards
text.t1=Lieutenant. Second-in-command to Teach. It was Richards who commanded Bonnet's "Revenge" when that ship was taken over.
text.t2=Richards was not with Teach at Ocracoke. So when did he leave?
text.t3=Richards was very ill when visiting Charles Vane. Teach's surgeons treated him. They may have been from La Tortue - Tortuga!
text.t4=A surgeon is living in a small wooden house - opposite the townhall.
text.t5=The gunsmith in Tortuga served as a third surgeon on La Concorde.
text.t6=The gunsmith's shop is in the stonehouse behind the tavern.
text.t7=The first surgeon is said to live on top of the sailmaker's workshop.
text.t8=I'll look for the flag down at the pier. There's the entrance to the sailmaker.
text.t9=The fourth or assistent surgeon lives in a carriage somewhere in the town.
text.t10=There's a carriage parked next to the surgeon in the upper part of the town.
text.t11=The assistent is in the 'Dovecote'. It's located on top of the tower.
text.t12=The the entrance to the tower is from the townhall.
text.t13=Richard had a sister - a nun in an Abbey. Probably in Cartagena.
text.t14=The Abbey: from the Port turn Left then Right. I have to pass through the Cloister to get to the Abbey.
text.t15=info about nun's cloister
text.t16=Sister Richards is in the Bell Tower. I saw the tower in the Graveyard.
text.t17=The Abbess has got the map. Her room is on the upper floor.
text.t18=I have to search the Crypts and the Small Chapel in the Graveyard for the eight(!) items belonging to the Abbess.
text.t19=I've got all eight items. Back to the Abbess for the other map-piece!
text.t20=I've got both map-pieces!
text.t21=The Abbess ripped a piece from Richard's map to use as a note. Incredible!
text.t22=I have to search for glue or something else to repair Richard's map.
text.t23=I've got all info from Richard's map now: the letter  I  and the  White Bay  port marked on Nevis island.
text.t24=There's not much remaining of a blue letter. And no port marked either.
text.t25=I've got half of a letter and the  White Bay  port marked on what I guess is Nevis island.
