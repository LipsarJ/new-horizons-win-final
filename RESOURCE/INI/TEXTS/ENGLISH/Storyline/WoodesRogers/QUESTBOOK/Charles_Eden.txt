title=Charles Eden
text.t1=Governor, his administration was marked by the arrest of the pirate Edward Teach. Eden had offered Teach the royal pardon.
text.t2=Charles Eden was Governor in Grand Cayman. He also was the owner of an Estate, but exactly where on that island? The new Governor would know.
text.t3=Maybe Eden's map is in his office.
text.t4=The exit to the Garden is behind the curtain in the Hall.
text.t5=I have got another map! The one Teach bribed Governor Charles Eden with. I'll examine it carefully.
text.t6=Mrs Pough will try to open some doors in the Estate for me.
text.t7=Israel Hands knows a way into the Office through the Wine Cellars. I'll follow him.
text.t8=I'll return later when I have more information. Guess it's the Office that's important. Maybe Teach brought some of his officers here when visiting Governor Eden?
text.t9=The Office door is up the stairs. But it's something with an elevator to open that door.
text.t10=The Barrel is too heavy but there's something under it.
text.t11=The letter  K  and a marked port  Sandy Point  is there. But on which island is that?
text.t12=It's Turks island!
