title=Woodes Rogers second reward
text.t1=There is another pistol for me to find. I must also search for the Kitchen key - maybe I should start looking in the Residence.
text.t2=I have got a key - now it's only the Kitchen that is missing. I have to explore the Residence and the Bedroom more closely.
text.t3=I have found another pistol, marked 'CSAR'. What's so fantastic with these guns? I'll ask Rogers when I return to the Residence.
