title=Sneak into the temple.
text.t1=By the Sea Devil! Rumors of treasure certainly attract the wrong sort of people! A whole pirate fleet was waiting for us off #sisland_Khael Roa#. How did those carrion-crows find out that we were sailing there? I don't understand it. After our battle, we landed on #sisland_Khael Roa#. The temple is in the heart of the island, and Aurentius warned us of traps we may find inside.
text.t2=Three thousand devils! It turns out that in order to get to that alcove, we need make our way through a labyrinth first. #sDanielle# decided we should split up, and ran off without waiting for our reply. I chose the central path of the labyrinth.
text.t3=On another note, I now have Governor Silehard in chains aboard ship. I don’t have time to decide what to do with him now, but after this all is over, I’ll have to decide. Do I take him back to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# for justice, somewhere else for some gold, or maybe give him a short walk and a sudden stop? Do I ransom him, or does he feed the fishes?
text.t4=Now that think of it, one of the memories I’ll carry with me to the end of my days is the sight of Silehard’s white hair slowly disappearing beneath the waves, deeper and deeper. I’d have liked an ending more… Personal, but I’ll take what I can get, I suppose.
text.t5=Well, just a moment to jot in this log... I wonder about #sDanielle# sometimes! There we were, in the most elaborate BY FAR ancient ruin I’ve ever seen... And not even a ruin, but a complete Temple complete with glowing swirling door thingies and a HUGE metal bird statue, and #sDanielle# sees a glowing ball floating above a pedestal, and before I could say "shouldn’t the learned man of books look at that first?", #spronoun# goes and nicks it and the whole place blows up! Stone flying everywhere, we’re lucky the three of us got out of there alive! Well, I sure hope it was worth it, that’s all I can say!
text.t6=Okay, I’ll admit it; perhaps it was not such a bad thing that #sDanielle# nearly got the professor and me killed beneath thousands of tons of flying rock. The cursed Black Pearl attacked us as we boarded ship again, and due to the magic in that ancient orb, which is no more, we were able to rid the seas of that ghostly, ghastly menace! Now, in the calm and quiet of my captain’s cabin, I can contemplate what to do next. Should I go to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#, make a report of what transpired here and what Silehard really was about? Or not?
text.t7= Now that think of it, one of the memories I’ll carry with me to the end of my days is the sight of Silehard’s white hair slowly disappearing beneath the waves, deeper and deeper. It was good to be able to throw him overboard myself though.
