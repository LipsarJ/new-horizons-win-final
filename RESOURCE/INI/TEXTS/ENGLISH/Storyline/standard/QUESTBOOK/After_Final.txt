title=After Final
text.t1=Well, the big battle is over and we've defeated the Black Pearl, which would have been impossible if not for that artifact #sDanielle# found. I wonder what the English think of us now! They must know Silehard betrayed them. Perhaps if we sail to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# there will be a reward. But no diplomat will be able to fix this unless we give them all we've gained, and I won't do that! In any case, when we arrive at #sisland_Redmond#, we'll have to get into town the back way, overland from Rocky Shore, just in case the English still feel unkindly towards us. But I have a feeling it will be all right. We should take Clement back to his lighthouse home on #sisland_Oxbay# too.
text.t2=So #sDanielle# will keep #spronoun3# immortality amulet, and stay always. We make a good team. Better to have #spronoun3# blade by my side than in my side! All is well.
text.t3=So #sDanielle# goes. Shakespeare said parting is sweet sorrow, but I'd be willing to wager he never said goodbye to #sDanielle Greene#! It's better this way. We're both too independent. It's not the end, though. We can't seem to avoid each other, so I'm sure we'll meet again. All is well.
text.t4=So #sDanielle# will get rid of that silly immortality amulet, which I'm sure means nothing. We make a good team. Better to have #spronoun3# blade by my side than in my side! All is well.
text.t5=Clement seems to be pretty worn out by all the excitement. We should get him home.
