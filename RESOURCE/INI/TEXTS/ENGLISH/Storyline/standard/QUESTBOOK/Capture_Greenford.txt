title=Free Clement Aurentius by capturing #sGreenford# colony.
text.t1=The English soldiers wanted us to join Aurentius in prison. They have been disappointed - fatally so, I'm afraid. Since we can scarcely hope to find another person in this archipelago to read those native texts, we have resolved to capture the #sGreenford# colony on #sisland_Oxbay#. Why waste energy on half-measures? With our bold plan, we're confident we'll get the old man out of jail. When we are ready to attack the colony, I'll make a landing by the lighthouse. #sDanielle# with part of the crew will attack the city from the land, and I'll concentrate on the fort. Thousand devils, what a fine time we will have!
text.t2=The English soldiers wished us to join Aurentius in prison so badly that they got hurt. And since we can't hope to find another man to read those native languages, we have determined to capture #sGreenford#. #sDanielle# will fight on the land, and I will take to the sea.
