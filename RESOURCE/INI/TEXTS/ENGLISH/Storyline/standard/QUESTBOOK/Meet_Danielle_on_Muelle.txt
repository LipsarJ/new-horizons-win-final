title=Meet #sDanielle# on #sIsla Muelle#.
text.t1=After I passed Anacleto Rui Sa Pinto's test, he offered me a deal. The pirate will give me the brig he captured, and in return I promised to punish his old enemy, Sidonio Ogarrio, who lives in the #sIsla Muelle# colony on #sisland_Isla Muelle# now. Anacleto can't go there because Spaniards are eager to see him hanging on the gallows.
text.t2=First I sailed to #sisland_Oxbay# in order to meet #sDanielle#, but Aurentius told me that #sDanielle# has set out in search of me. Ah, these #swomen# - where the dickens has #spronoun# sailed?
text.t3=To my great surprise, when my new ship entered #sIsla Muelle#'s harbour on #sisland_Isla Muelle#, I saw my old ship at an anchor there. My fellows met me ashore. It turned out that they managed to survive the storm, and then reached the nearest port and made repairs on the ship.
text.t4=Another fortunate chance has occurred. I met #sDanielle# at #sIsla Muelle#'s tavern, and #spronoun# told me that #spronoun# has those clay tablets where the legend is recorded. #sPronoun_upper#'s lost #spronoun3# ship, and #spronoun# plans to sail on my ship for some time. #sPronoun_upper#'s made a copy of those native tablets, and we are going to Aurentis. I remember he boasted of his knowledge of native languages, so perhaps he'll be able to translate the legend of the Temple of the Sun God.
text.t5=Having dropped anchor by lighthouse on #sisland_Oxbay#, #sDanielle# and I climbed to the top of the rock. It turned out that English soldiers were waiting for us by the lighthouse rather than Aurentis. It turned out that poor old man has been arrested by order of Governor Silehard for giving aid to traitors to the English crown - that is, #sDanielle# and me. Now he is held in #sGreenford#'s prison.
