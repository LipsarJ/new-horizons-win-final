title=Reconnoiter captured #sOxbay# city.
text.t1=Perhaps I shouldn't have told the governor that #sOxbay# was attacked. When he heard my news, he began immediate preparations for war, and nearly commandeered my ship. I had to join the King's army in order to save my ship. The first task the Governor gave me is to land on #sisland_Oxbay# island not far from the captured city, then sneak into the city and learn all I can about the French squadron and any further plans of the French.
text.t2=When I got into the city #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay#, I managed to talk to the local tavern-keeper whose name is Everard Gordon. He told me that local citizens are ready to give any help in order to free #sOxbay#. The French behave outrageously, and the locals hate them. The tavern keeper also told me that the French are filling up their crews with volunteers. That's a good opportunity for sending out a spy to the French. During our conversation, I got the idea to make friends with some French officer, get him drunk, then tease all the information I need out of him.
text.t4=Everything worked as I hoped. Under threat of death, the drunken Massoni told me that the barque 'Oiseau' is at #sFalaise de Fleur# harbor on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. That very barque is supposed to deliver ammunition to the French squadron, but it's not going to put to sea unless they find a suitably strong escort ship. Should I inform Silehard about that, or just sail to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and find out about everything by myself?
text.t5=After I reported to Silehard, he gave me some gold and told me to prevent the barque 'Oiseau' to reach #sisland_Oxbay#. But that is much easier said than done! If I am to engage in a sea battle with her, I should first ensure I can win. But perhaps if I can get to #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and find out what the situation is there, I'll be able to think of another way to complete the mission.
text.t6=A sailor from the barque 'Oiseau' told me that French authorities hired a brig under the command of a certain Amiel Berangere to escort the barque to #sisland_Oxbay#. I think I should talk to that fellow. The sailor said that I can ask people in the local #sFalaise de Fleur#'s tavern about Berangere. He is a regular visitor there.
text.t7=I talked to the #sFalaise de Fleur# tavern keeper named Antoine Lebretton. I learned that Berangere rented a room from Lebretton, and that he's probably in there right now.
text.t8=Amiel Berangere gave me the honor to escort the 'Oiseau' barque to #sisland_Oxbay# island. He gave me a letter of identification. Now I need to show the letter to the harbor master of #sFalaise de Fleur#. He'll introduce me to the captain of the barque, Virgile Boon, and then we'll be ready to sail. But before I do that, I should ensure I and my ship are ready to execute my cunning plans. That barque will never make it to #sOxbay#, hahaha!
text.t9=Amiel Berangere turned out to be an extremely intractable person. Well, he paid for that with his life. I took a letter of identification from his dead body. I should show it to #sFalaise de Fleur#'s harbor master. Then it seems I'll have to meet the captain of the barque. But before I do that, I should ensure I and my ship are ready to execute my cunning plans.
text.t10=I got lucky. Amiel Berangere will take care of all my problems. He'll be happy to sink the barque 'Oiseau' and its poor captain. Admittedly, it cost me no small sum to persuade Amiel to follow the pirate's road, but now I can return to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# and report the mission complete as ordered.
text.t11=I showed the letter of identification to the harbor master, and he introduced me to Virgile Boon. Now we are ready to put to sea at any moment. I hope that during the sail I'll be able to snatch the opportunity to board or sink Virgile's wash-tub. I must ensure the odds are stacked in my favour though.
text.t12=I've done it! I've completed the mission! The French will be without ammunition, and I expect a handsome reward for my services.
text.t13=We just left the town, and I killed Massoni. Before soldiers approached me, I searched his body. It appears that Massoni was escorting a barque named 'Oiseau' to the French colony, #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. There the barque will be loaded with supplies and armaments. But now that Massoni is not available to accompany them, the barque won't sail to #sOxbay# until they find a new escort ship.
