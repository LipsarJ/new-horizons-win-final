title=Escape from #sOxbay#
text.t1.p1=That was a close call! As a first officer of Malcolm Hatcher I commanded our ship to anchor in #sOxbay# port on #sisland_Oxbay#. We were close to shore when we heard the sound of cannonades. Some time after I called the captain it turned out that a large French squadron was attacking #sOxbay# fort; we were terrified when the town surrendered to the enemy nearly immediately. Things went quickly and while we observed the events in the harbour, a French frigate intercepted our retreat. I thought this would be our last stand and now I could forget about my plans to take over Malcolm's ship.
text.t1.p2= I didn't value Hatcher's commanding skills: he managed to set our ship in a position where only that one vessel could attack us, while the other ships were too far or they could risk damaging friendly targets when opening fire. Even that one ship, I thought, should be more than enough to finish all of us; however the courage of the captain and crew, the good properties of the ship and a favorable wind allowed for us to escape and now the frog frigate is down in Davy Jones' Locker. We sailed away to another port, where Malcolm retired and now the ship is mine!
