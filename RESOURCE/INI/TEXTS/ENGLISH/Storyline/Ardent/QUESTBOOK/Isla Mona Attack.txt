title=The Battle of Isla Mona
text.t1=The French have taken over #sisland_Isla Mona#! Apparently it's only a single frigate. I rather like the idea of taking a frigate.
text.t2=That's dealt with the frigate. I wonder what sort of force they've put ashore? Maybe I can restore this to a free outpost.
text.t3=The Taino weren't pleased to see me defeat the French in their village. They fear reprisals. They will trust me more if I also defeat the French in the old fort.
text.t4=The French had moved into the old English fort but hadn't finished rebuilding its defences. And I've captured their captain. Unfortunately, he told me that a larger force is on the way. Time to see if the Taino can join in.
text.t5=I have ordered my other ships to make their own way to #sSanto Domingo#. When the new force arrives, I'll either capture it as well or, if it's too big, pretend to be French myself and just sail away. I can rejoin my other ships at #sSanto Domingo# later.
text.t6=Alright, we have a plan. If the French attack the fort, the Taino will hit them from behind. If the French attack the Taino village, we'll hit them from behind. Either way, the French will be crushed between us and the Taino. I hope...
text.t7=The main force has been wiped out. But we need to convince the fleet that their troops are in place. They'll be expecting the frigate's troops to return to the ship, so that's what they'll see, except it will be my men in French uniform. There are certainly plenty of uniforms to use!
text.t8=I shall also want to move my other ships away from here. One of my captains should be on the beach somewhere.
text.t9=This was all just part of a bigger plan. The French intend a sneak attack on #sRedmond#. And #svillain# is going to let them in. But now I need to slip away from the French fleet under cover of night. Then I can either leave #sRedmond# to its fate, or I can warn them - perhaps the governor will reward me.
text.t10=This was all just a diversion. The French hope that when their enemies learn that France now owns #sisland_Isla Mona#, they will believe France intends to attack #sSanto Domingo# or #sIsla Muelle#. Meanwhile their real attack will be somewhere else...
text.t11=As soon as night falls, I shall attempt to sneak away from the French fleet.
text.t12=I have managed to slip away from the French fleet.
text.t13=I have managed to slip away from the French fleet. Now I must rejoin my own fleet at #sSanto Domingo#.
text.t14=I have rejoined my fleet.
text.t15=Take that, French Navy! Two frigates and a 3rd rate warship, and I defeated the lot!
