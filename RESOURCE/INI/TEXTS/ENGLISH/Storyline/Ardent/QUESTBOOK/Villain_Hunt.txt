title=The Hunt for #svillain#
text.t1=#svillain# is now a wanted #spronoun# - wanted for treason against England, that is. There's a reward for bringing #spronoun2# in, dead or alive. Perhaps Gilbert Downing knows where to find #spronoun2#.
text.t2=#svillain# has gone to #sPhilipsburg# on the island #sisland_Saint Martin#. But Gilbert Downing does not know which ship #spronoun# used. The harbour master may know.
text.t3=#svillain# sailed from #sRedmond# on the East Indiaman named '#sship#'.
text.t4=The tavernkeeper in #sPhilipsburg# has not heard of #svillain# or the '#sship#', and suggested that I ask around in the port.
text.t5=There's no sign that #svillain# has been in #sPhilipsburg#. But as #spronoun# is in league with the French, #spronoun# may be in #sMarigot# instead.
text.t6=#svillain# was in #sMarigot# but left for #sPointe a Pitre# on the island of #sisland_Guadeloupe#. I also learned that a large French warship, the '#swarship#', is here in #sMarigot#. What would the English navy pay to know that? The answer may be at their base on #sisland_Antigua#.
text.t7=The admiral in #sSt John's# paid me #samount# gold up front for the information about the '#sship#'. It may pay to return if I learn anything else of value.
text.t8=The admiral in #sSt John's# paid me #samount1# gold up front for the information about the '#sship#', and will pay me a further #samount2# after he has verified what I told him. I should return in a couple of weeks.
text.t9=The admiral in #sSt John's# has promised to pay me #samount# gold for the information about the '#sship#' when he has verified it. I should return in two weeks.
text.t10=True to his word, the admiral of #sSt John's# has paid me the #samount# he owed me. It may pay to return if I learn anything else of value.
text.t11=The English sent a squadron to attack the '#swarship#' and the battle did not go well for them. In return for being almost wiped out, all the English force managed to do was eliminate her escort.
text.t12=I learned from one of the crew of the '#sship#' that #svillain# is in #sPointe a Pitre# right now.
text.t13=Now I'm out of prison again, I wonder what #svillain# wanted with the French admiral? It's night now - I could try to find an 'unofficial' way into the naval building and see what I can pick up.
text.t14=I found plans for an attack on #sRedmond# in the naval building in #sPointe a Pitre#. The admiral of #sisland_Antigua# would undoubtedly pay well for those documents!
text.t15=This isn't good. #svillain# has captured me and I'm tied up in the hold of my own ship - the indignity of it! I don't know how I'm going to get out of this one...
text.t16=This isn't good. #svillain# has captured me and I'm tied up in the hold of my own ship - the indignity of it! Worse yet, #sromance# appears to have sided with #spronoun#. I don't know how I'm going to get out of this one...
text.t17=What luck! The cook's assistant hid when #svillain#'s men boarded my ship, then sneaked into the hold and released me. I've dealt with the few enemy crew who were left on the ship. Now I'm in #sPort au Prince# and my crew are being held in the fort. Should I try attacking the fort to rescue them? Or perhaps someone at the buccaneers' camp can forge some sort of release document, then I may be able to simply walk in and get my crew back. If so, any such forger will need a specimen of the governor's signature, so I'll need to get one somehow.
text.t18=What a relief! #sromance# hasn't sided with #svillain# after all - #spronoun# only said that to trick #svillain_pronoun#! Then #spronoun# came to the hold to release me. I've dealt with the few enemy crew who were left on the ship and am now in #sPort au Prince#. My crew are being held in the fort. I could try attacking the fort to rescue them, but #sromance# has suggested using #spronoun3# talent for forgery to create a release document. First I'll need a specimen of the governor's signature, by any means necessary...
text.t19=I found a forger in the buccaneers' camp. To do the job, he needs a specimen of the governor's signature. Back to town, then...
text.t20=Now I have the fake release order, I'd better change into a French uniform to look convincing when trying to use it.
text.t21=Success! The crew are free and we can get back to the ship. And then what? #svillain# has sailed for #sSantiago#, possibly to scout the fort in advance of a French attack. But first they'll go for #sRedmond#. If I want to get involved, which should I try first?
text.t22=Success! The crew are free and we can get back to the ship. And then what? #svillain# has sailed for #sSantiago#, possibly to scout the fort in advance of a French attack. But first they'll go for #sRedmond#. And I haven't forgotten that the admiral of #sisland_Antigua# still owes me money. Where to go first?
text.t23=Success! The crew are free and we can get back to the ship. And then what? #svillain# has sailed for #sSantiago#, possibly to scout the fort in advance of a French attack. But first they'll go for #sRedmond#. And the admiral of #sisland_Antigua# may be able to help if I show him the battle plans I found at #sPointe a Pitre#. Where to go first?
text.t24=I have found a document signed by the governor of #sPort au Prince#. Hopefully this will be a suitable specimen for a forgery.
text.t25=Not wanting to wear that uncomfortable uniform again, I paid extra for a document which says I'm a plantation owner who wants to use the prisoners as slave labour.
text.t26=Now I need to leave the forger to do the job. I should return tomorrow.
text.t27=I have paid for a pardon from France - a pardon signed by the governor of #sPort au Prince#. An expensive way to get an autograph, but it should be good for forgery purposes.
text.t28=I have paid for a Letter of Marque from France - a Letter signed by the governor of #sPort au Prince#. An expensive way to get an autograph, but it should be good for forgery purposes.
text.t29=I have obtained a signature directly from the governor of #sPort au Prince#. That should do nicely for forgery purposes!
