title=Inca Temple
text.t1=The Taino chief told me how his people "fled a great darkness" in the "land of the setting sun". He's convinced that "setting sun" means west, i.e. #sisland_Hispaniola#, and that the "darkness" was the Inca. So he wants me to raid an Inca temple and find some evidence the Taino were sacrificed there. In any case, if there is such a temple it's bound to contain treasure. But first I'll need to look for a guide in the taverns of #sSanto Domingo# and #sPort au Prince#.
text.t2=This is too easy. Apart from the Akellani who have taken over the temple, that is. Markings on the floor are leading me somewhere but it may not be where I will find what I am looking for. I should keep an eye on passages leading off the marked route in case an interesting room is down one of them. But I shouldn't stray too far from the marked route or I'll get lost.
text.t3=I found an old cloth which might be what the Taino chief wants.
text.t4=Where's my ship? She's not where I left her, at Cape Francos. The only sensible places where the crew might have gone are the buccaneer camp near Boca de Hubon, or #sTortuga#. Boca de Hubon is nearer so I should try the buccaneer camp first.
text.t5=Mauricio Juradu tricked the crew into believing I'd ordered the ship to move to Boca de Hubon in case of attack by the Akellani. He was trying to recruit a gang to board and take the ship when I interrupted him.
text.t6=Soaring Hawk was pleased with the cloth from the temple. It belonged to the Taino long ago and was lost before they escaped the Inca to move to #sisland_Isla Mona#, and proves the Taino did indeed start out from #sisland_Hispaniola#.
text.t7=Soaring Hawk was disappointed that I returned without any evidence that the Taino originated on #sisland_Hispaniola#.
