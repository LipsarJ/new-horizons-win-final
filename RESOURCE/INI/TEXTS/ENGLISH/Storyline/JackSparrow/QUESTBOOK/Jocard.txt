title=A Free Slave.
text.t1=In #sOranjestad# on #sisland_Aruba#, I saw two men fighting on the street. I do not get involved in fights so I let them go.
text.t2=The man I've saved is Gombo, and a former slave. I saved him from this fate by not fighting with him. Judging by his word, a good navigator. I made him a member of my crew.
text.t3=The man I've saved is Gombo, and a former slave. I saved him from this fate by not fighting with him. Judging by his word, a good navigator. After I declined to add him to my crew, he said he will wait for me in the Dutch settlement on #sisland_Aruba# if I should change my mind.
text.t4=I think I saw Gombo in #sEleuthera#'s port on arriving in #sisland_Eleuthera#. It looks like he was going to #sEleuthera#'s town. Interesting. What is he up to?
text.t5=I learned that Gombo was here in the tavern. He spoke with some Spanish fellow. Then three other people entered the tavern and confronted Gombo and the wounded fellow Gombo was speaking with. The wounded fellow is in the cellar downstairs now, so perhaps he knows where Gombo has gone.
text.t6=Oh, dear. The first thing I saw when I came upstairs was the knife in the fellow's chest. I came too late... he was already dead.
text.t7=Considering how lucky I am, it is not surprising that when I went downstairs, soldiers came upon me, and accused me of the murder of this poor man. I was forced to kill them, because I have to find Gombo. I don't think it will be easy for me to get out of town now. Maybe it would be better to make my way to the port? I'm not sure that Gombo is somewhere here, but I doubt that he will live long.
text.t8=I decided to go with the soldiers. I hope that my innocence will be quickly proven.
text.t9=That's taken care of, thank heavens. They found witnesses that saw the murderer. I've been set free, and now I can leave the island, or try to find Gombo. I suspect he is here somewhere.
text.t10=In the plantation near the town I saw strange people standing over Gombo's dead body.
text.t11=After I showed the slavers the papers I 'commandeered' off their comrade, I found that Gombo was not dead. I asked him why he was kidnapped. And he told me about a ship whose cargo holds are filled with silver! The ship sank near #sisland_Douwesen#, so you can't reach it by sea, but there is a path through the waterfall. There's a promise of rich treasure in this affair.
text.t12=My strained relations with the English authorities caused me a big headache, but somehow Gombo took care of that through his connections - the English seem to have miraculously forgotten about my past misdeeds.
text.t13=I saw Gombo running in #sDouwesen# port to the town. Interesting. What is he up to?
text.t14=I went upstairs in the tavern, I've found that Gombo was lying on the ground but not dead. I asked him why he was kidnapped. And he told me about a ship whose cargo holds are filled with silver! The ship sank near #sisland_Douwesen#, so you can't reach it by sea, but there is a path through the waterfall. There's a promise of rich treasure in this affair.
text.t15=Gombo was telling the truth. I believe I can get about 50000 for this silver, of course I'll take 25000 and give Jocard the other 25000. He also said that we should head to #sEleuthera# on #sisland_Eleuthera# by sneaking in by a cellar.
text.t16=Got into the tavern via the cellar, now to head for the plantation.
text.t17=Killed the remaining guards at the plantation and then set the slaves free. I then went to Jocard's ship where he requested for me to help him save more slaves. I did not want to put my life at risk so declined and took 20000 gold from him and left him behind.
text.t18=The slavers recognized Jocard. They decided to knock us out and steal 5000 gold off both of us. We now can not save the slaves so Jocard and my quest is finished.
