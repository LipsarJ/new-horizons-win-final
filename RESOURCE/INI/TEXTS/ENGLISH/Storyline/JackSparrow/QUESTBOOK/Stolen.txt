title=Ship Stolen!
text.t1=That bloody Maltese Knight, Jaoquin de Masse, has gone and stolen the #suncursed_ship#. I don't know if I will ever see it again. 
text.t2=That dog Barbossa has taken my ship, my map and my compass. Now I must work out how to get off this island.
text.t3=I met a group of smugglers and have agreed to sail their boat to #sTortuga# off the coast of #sisland_Hispaniola#.
text.t4=When I walked out of the tavern I looked at my compass, I saw it was pointing towards Anamaria's boat, I'm sure I can borrow it.
text.t5=On sailing out of the harbour my compass started pointing at #sisland_Redmond# (after it pointed at a bottle of rum). I will sail to #sRedmond# and see if I can get another ship. At least that will be a step towards getting the #scursed_ship# back..
text.t6=We made it to #sTortuga#. I will look in the tavern to see what's going on here and get an idea of what to do next.
text.t7=I have had another ship stolen from me! This time on arriving in #sTortuga# off the coast of #sisland_Hispaniola# I left the tavern to find her sailing away from the island.
text.t8=Now that's an interesting ship. Perhaps I'll take a look, or maybe I'll see if Henry the beggar has any advice for me first.
text.t9=I have spoken with Henry and I have decided to talk to the soldiers on the dock about the ships in the harbour.
text.t10=I have spoken with Henry and I have decided to go and see Governor Weatherby in the Residence to see what he can offer.
text.t11=I have spoken with Henry and I have decided to give up chasing the #scursed_ship# and go off on my own.
