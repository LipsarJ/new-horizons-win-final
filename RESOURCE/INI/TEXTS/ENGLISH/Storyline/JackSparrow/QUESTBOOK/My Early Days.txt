title=My Early Days
text.t1=Well, here I am footloose and fancy free, and out to make my name and fortune. The best place to find an adventure, which might suit my purposes, will be the tavern I'm thinking, so I'll just see what the flotsam in the port here has for sale, talk to a few characters, then I'll go to the tavern. 
text.t2=It looks like I could be on to some easy money here. How much trouble could helping a damsel in distress be? 
text.t3=So, it's off to #sGreenford#. I can go by land or sea. Either way shouldn't take long, but I know the lady will be safer if we go by sea.
text.t4=The Tavern does seem a logical place to start, so we should go there.
text.t5=So, it's #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# I need to look for Miss Brin's family. I know there is a pirate settlement there.
text.t6=So now I have the option, #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# or Gray Rock Bay. Well, the bay is nearer, but I did promise to help Annabella. Decisions, decisions.
text.t7=Now I'm working with the Excise! And she wants to go to #sTortuga# off the island #sisland_Hispaniola# under a pirate flag. I hope this doesn't get complicated.
text.t8=I've lost my ship! I have the diamonds though some of which I can use to buy a new one till I catch up with Shaypen again. Perhaps I should go to #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# after all, but I need a new ship, in which case I should go back to #sOxbay# first. More decisions.
text.t9=We've found out that Brinkley is heading for a Dutch Island. Bootstrap Bill says to sail for #sWillemstad# on #sisland_Curacao#.
text.t10=So now I've assaulted an Excise Agent. That won't look good. I'd better see what I can find out about the Brin family in the pirate settlement.
text.t11=I met my father after many years. He's a pirate and is worried about something about to happen here, and wants my help. Not sure about that, I'm not a pirate. I've been told about troubles that are coming. Too much information for the moment. I think I'll go to #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay# and take life as it comes.
text.t12=I met Thomas the Terror. He seems to be a member of the Brotherhood. We are to sail to #sOxbay# together. He said to sail east-south-east as we leave the harbour till we reach #sisland_Redmond#. Pass that on our portside, then sail ESE to #sisland_Oxbay#.
text.t13=Here I am footloose and fancy free, and out to make my name and fortune. I need to talk to some people around here in the port, see what the merchants have, then go to the tavern to find an adventure.
