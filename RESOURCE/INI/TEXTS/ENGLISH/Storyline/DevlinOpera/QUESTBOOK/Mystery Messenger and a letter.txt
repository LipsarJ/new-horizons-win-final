title=Mystery Messenger and a letter
text.t1=When I landed in port some stranger gave me a letter from the Harbour Master, but it was in my father's handwriting. I need to go and see this Harbour Master. 
text.t2=I met my uncle, who I haven't seen since I was a child. He told me that I have a twin sister, and my Father has sent me a treasure map.
