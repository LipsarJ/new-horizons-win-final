title=Rescue my crew
text.t1=I met the English pirate William Klein in the #sGrand Cayman# tavern. After explaining my situation over a rum or two, he agreed to bring me to #sisland_Cuba# and help me release my crew from the Spaniards. In return, both I and my crew will join his own sailors. He lets me sail his Lugger moored in the port. I decided it would not be wise to sail into #sHavana# port though. I might get recognized for being a fugitive pirate. Instead we'll make berth at one of the shores. Bahia de San Antonio would be a good place.
text.t2=The shore wasn't as safe as I thought. We were met by a patrol of Spanish soldiers when we landed there. I hope we will encounter no more patrols on our way through the jungle. We must get to #sHavana# as soon as we can.
text.t3=Apparently the execution is just about to begin. We must get to the church immediately!
text.t4=William and I managed to release my crew. We'd better get back to the beach and leave this island though. But where is Emilio?
text.t5=We met with a Spanish ambush on our way back to the ship. Fortunately, they were no match for us. We'd better go to the ship quickly.
text.t6=At last, I know what happened to Emilio. He escaped shortly after me and most likely went to #sSantiago#. We should go there and find out if anybody has seen him. Emilio wanted to find a ship to leave the island, so there's probably a sailor in port who has seen him.
text.t7=We have found a good Samaritan at the port who has helped Emilio. He probably wouldn't have survived in #sSantiago# without this man. Emilio is currently out for a stroll outside the city. We are going to see if we can find him.
text.t8=The hardest part is finally over. We agreed to go to #sRedmond# now to discuss my future partnership with William.
text.t9=On arrival at #sRedmond#, we were cornered by a bunch of mercenaries sent by the #sHavana# governor. I dealt with them quickly. Unfortunately, William has been killed by a mercenary. I announced the bad news to his crew. They were sad but as life must go on - they convinced me to be their new Captain. I swore they'll be rich under my command. What to do next - I could prepare a new expedition with Roxanne, I know she lives at #sPointe a Pitre# on #sisland_Guadeloupe#.
