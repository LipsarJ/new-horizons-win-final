title=The Silver Train
text.t1=I have nothing to lose in going to #sisland_Battle Rocks#. If Captain Henry Morgan is right, it could be a grand jackpot! Let's weigh anchor, I'm eager to be there.
text.t2=What a load of fish guts that story was! Silver at #sisland_Battle Rocks#! The only things I would find there are mosquitos, snakes and disease. I'm going to capture some enemy ships and forget this whole story ever happened. 
text.t3=What rotten luck! First we lost time in finding a safe anchorage and then we had fight a group of indians. I hope the situation and my luck will improve.
text.t4=Good news! We have confirmation. There is a mine at #sisland_Battle Rocks#. A fugitive called Konrad Kulczycki told us. Nevertheless, the mine is well-protected and I would expect no less. If it had not, there probably would be no jackpot.
text.t5=The Spanish camp was hidden in the jungle. After a risky attack, we defeated the enemy. We did the same at the mine to free the Konrad Kulczycki's friends. However, I expected to look for the silver in the camp when I learned it was en route to a secret port. Fortunately, we have a good chance to get there before the silver train.
text.t6=Arrived at the Spanish Port, we have been located by a soldier hidden in the small fort. He succeeded in warning the convoy and we have had to fight the Spanish soldiers. But it was worth it. The silver was really there. After a long walk through the jungle, the silver is in the ships' hold. Now, we just need to reach #sTortuga#.
text.t7=This expedition has been a success. Indeed, 60 000 gold coins is quite a tidy sum. As a bonus, we helped to release a great many pirates from the Spaniards. Now, the question is if the Spaniards are going to leave #sisland_Battle Rocks# soon. In the meantime, I could go for instance to #sOxbay# to rest a bit.
