title=Unexpected incident
text.t1=What bad luck! To meet a Spanish Battleship off #sisland_Khael Roa#, what are the odds? She won the short battle and damaged my ship. I need to get away to #sisland_Cuba# and find a deserted shore and repair the hull.
text.t2=Can it get worse???. My ship was lost during the storm with some of my men. Thinking we were safe on land after the ordeal at sea, we set out to cross the Cuban jungle, and then a Spanish patrol!!! I've had to flee but now what to do? I should look for someone in this jungle willing to help me, my luck must change soon.
text.t3=At last a ray of sunshine in my dark hours, I met a smuggler at Playa de Sabana. He agreed to help me but not quite as I would have liked. Indeed, he was afraid to attack the Spaniards, but, he offered to take me to #sisland_Cayman#. I may find a captain and crew willing to help me to free my poor crew. To the tavern, it's a good place to find captains and a little rum always improves the chances.
