title=The parchment
text.t1=I have found a dirty parchment on the shore. Close to the hull of a ship's long boat.
text.t2=My drawing of the Goldbug on the dirty Parchment.
text.t3=My drawing of the Goldbug, but on the other side there is a Death's-head now!
text.t4=More heat and now together with the Death's-head appears a Goat!
text.t5=It's the heat that reveals the secrets of this document!
text.t6=I'll try to rinse the parchment with hot water!
text.t7=There are some some figures arranged in lines! Part of a text it seems.
text.t8=Yes yes yes. I knew there was more. A lot of characters are rudely traced between the Death's-head and the Goat!
text.t9=The Parchment is clean but maybe I should try to heat it up again?
