text.t1=I was cleared of the mutiny charge. Sadly Archie confessed to a crime he did not commit. Sharpe and I are going to track down Lieutenant Quelp on #sisland_Cayman#.
text.t2=Sharpe is sure he saw a midshipman run out of the tavern. I'm not sure though. We met Lieutenant Quelp who tried to explain himself. Captain Harvey has ordered me to sail to #sSt John's# on #sisland_Antigua#.
