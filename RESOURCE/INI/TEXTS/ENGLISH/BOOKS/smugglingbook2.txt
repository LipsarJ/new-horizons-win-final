Dear reader, as you've probably noticed by now, there is more then one way to smuggle in the Caribbean. While islands may be in need of specific goods which can be provided by our brethren, there may also be some individuals who have special needs. These people we can supply as well.

Of coure I am talking about the smuggling of opium. Believe me when I say that established order doesn't approve of this stuff and would like to have it removed completely from the Caribbean. But they haven't yet found every Opium Den. I suggest that before you start smuggling opium, you first try to find this Opium Den. It is probably located in one of the larger towns in the Caribbean and if you ask some random town folk, they can probably tell you where to look.

Once you have figured out where to get the goods, you can find a client. In the past we had to find our own clients, but nowadays the smugglers' guild keeps a list of clients and they will share this list with you.

If you've found your client, you should talk to him to hear what he needs and get this in the Opium Den. Be careful on your way back though! The guards might find out you've got forbidden goods on you. I strongly suggest to only buy what you need because these guards will keep looking for a long time! Once you've procured your goods, you should head back to the client and he should pay you a nice amount of money.

Beware that all opium buyers become dealers once you have delivered their supply. So when you've helped one client, you should always first go help another one again before you try the old one once more.

I wish you all the luck with your opium adventure.
