My husband,

Not knowing where you are, I cannot send these last words to you, but I pray you will come back to read them. Do not forget me completely, Horatio, when I'm gone. Though we've been married for so long a time, we were only together for so short a time, but I'm not sorry.

I know you have not loved me deeply, Horatio, but I have loved you more for never betraying it. I know it was because you were sorry for me, and because a sailor needed someone to come home to, and I pray now that you will come home to our son.

Your loving wife,
Maria
