title=Side Quest - Help the #sisland_Turks# island settlement
text.t1=I met Dutch captain Pieter Boelen in the #sGrand Turk# tavern. He asked me to go to #sSantiago# on #sisland_Cuba# to find out if the rumours about a Spanish attack on #sisland_Turks# are true. He'll pay 20000 gold if I succeed. I need to find a #sSantiago# official to trick into providing the information. The local tavern is usually a good place to find information, so I'll try there first.
text.t2=I found a Spanish officer in the #sSantiago# tavern and I told him a fish story about some smugglers at the beach. I then sailed to the beach to wait for the officer to arrive. I hadn't counted on the Spanish officer bringing some backup though, but I dealt with them quickly. The officer agreed to answer my questions after that. I put him in the brig of my ship and I'll release him when this situation is resolved. I need to go to #sisland_Turks# quickly before the Spanish arrive to invade the island. I must meet Pieter in the tavern to give him the news.
text.t3=What misfortune! The Spanish have speeded up their invasion. I must get to the lighthouse at Turtle Bay to prevent the Spanish from landing.
text.t4=That was an amazing fight! The Spanish were with many, but we beat them in the end. It seems that the galleon is weighing anchor. I should get back to the city to see how Pieter has been doing.
text.t5=Pieter has prevented the landing at the port, but his ship, the 'Amsterdam' got damaged during the battle. He now needs my help to get him to #sTortuga# off the coast of #sisland_Hispaniola# to ask for assistance of the pirates there in case the Spanish try to attack again.
text.t6=After a short journey to #sTortuga#, I've left Pieter at the port. I'm sure he will find all the help he needs there. He has also given me 40000 gold coins as a reward, two times more than we agreed upon. I have been talking to the Spanish officer, Diego Cordoba, during the voyage and it turns out that though he might be an honest soldier, he does have some friends at #sTortuga# who will take him back to #sisland_Cuba#, so I let him go here as I promised.
text.t7=I met Dutch captain Pieter Boelen in the #sGrand Turk# tavern. He asked me to go to #sSantiago# on #sisland_Cuba# to find out if the rumours about a Spanish attack on #sisland_Turks# are true. I have other priorities though. He should find someone else.
text.t8=I've lost too much time during the journey, so the mission is over. I just hope Pieter and the other pirates have been able to fend off whatever the Spanish governor has sent their way.
