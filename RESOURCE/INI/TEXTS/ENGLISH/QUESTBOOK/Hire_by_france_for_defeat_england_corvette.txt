title=Side Quest - Sink the Pirate Frigate.
text.t1=The governor of #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#, #sJoseph Claude Le Moigne#, charged me with a mission to sink the pirate ship blockading the colony while the #sFrench# squadron is at sea.
text.t2=I had to refuse #sLe Moigne#. 5000 gold is not reward enough for such risks. It's no small matter to battle with a #sheavy frigate#. It appears that the governor was upset by my refusal.
text.t3=The governor was pleased with my performance. He gave me the reward and told me to keep in touch. He wants to work with me in the future as well.
