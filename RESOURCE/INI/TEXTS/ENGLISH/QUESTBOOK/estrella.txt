title=Side Quest - Help the Lady
text.t1=Met Doña Estrella de Alençar in the church in #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Beautiful lady! And what a story. She's got a pirate lover, and has hired me to find out whether he is still alive. I have to sail to #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# and talk to the innkeeper of #sQuebradas Costillas# to find Armand Delacroix.
text.t2=Delacroix is mad to try to sneak past the Spanish Navy. I cannot risk my life like that, so I told him no.
text.t3=Diaz warned me that Delacroix might kill me, but Armand is a rare fellow, dangerous and charming at the same time. Reminds me of myself, actually! He's convinced me to help him in a crazy scheme to get Doña Estrella off of #sisland_Isla Muelle#. I have to sail to Oyster Beach and head to town and tell her of our plan. This will be dangerous, but hopefully rewarding.
text.t4=Estrella will meet me outside the tavern at midnight, wearing a disguise. I hope she can put something together so she can pass as a man, or we'll be in big trouble.
text.t5=Well, they're gone. I will miss Armand, he was a good fellow for a ruthless bloodthirsty pirate. And the beautiful brave lady! I wonder if I'll ever hear from them. (no letter is at #sQuebradas Costillas# - YET! To be continued!)
