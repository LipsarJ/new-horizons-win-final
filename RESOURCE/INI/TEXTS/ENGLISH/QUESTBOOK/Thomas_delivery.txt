title=Side Quest - Cargo for #sThomas O'Reily#
text.t1=Well, only a paltry sum gold to deliver a cargo of #samount# of #scargo# to the #snation# town of #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and one #sArnaud Matton#. #sThomas# was stingy, but I’m taking this order because I get the feeling there may be more to come in the future if I do...
text.t2=#sArnaud# had been sure that #sThomas# had double-crossed him, what with all the hostility between #snationF# and #snationR#. Well, now for me to go back and collect my reward from Thomas, then to see what lies in the future!
text.t3=Well, that was easy enough! #sThomas# was happy his goods got to #sFalaise de Fleur#, but I’m going to have to talk to him about another job later. I think there may be something interesting up his sleeve!
text.t4=#sArnaud# had been sure that #sThomas# had double-crossed him, what with all the pirates raiding #snation# ships. Well, now for me to go back and collect my reward from #sThomas#, then to see what lies in the future!
