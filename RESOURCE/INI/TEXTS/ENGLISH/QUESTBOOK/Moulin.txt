title=Side Quest - Find Angelique Moulin's Father
text.t1=Angelique Moulin has lost her father, François. She seems a nice girl, so I decided to help her find him. According to her, her father probably didn't leave the island, so he probably went into the jungle. The Buccaneers know everything going on in the jungle, so I'll go to their camp and see if I can find out if they know anything about François.
text.t2=I went to the Buccaneer's camp and found out that François is at Boca de Hubon, a shore near the camp, right now. He is busy there loading a ship owned by a Dutch pirate with contraband. After that, he'll leave the island. I'd better hurry to get there.
text.t3=I understand what's going on now. A soldier has been embezzling the money of the authorities and François knows of it. He will not need to flee the island though. I am going to see that officer in the fort and sort this all out.
text.t4=What a horrible coward! He seized the opportunity when I was absent-minded to attack me. I killed him and had to fight my way out of the fort. Now I suppose it's time to go back to the Buccaneers camp to tell François Moulin that his troubles are over. But he'll be asleep at night.
text.t5=François Moulin was clearly relieved when he heard of #sAntoineChamfort#'s death. Now we just have to meet Angelique at #sPort au Prince#. 
text.t6=François and Angelique are both safe now. I hope they will stay out of trouble now.
text.t7=The journal François Moulin gave me is a very interesting read, even though most of it can't be made out. I think the island mentioned might be #sisland_Antigua#. I should go there once and try to find that mysterious hidden item.
text.t8=I don't believe it! The hidden item was the sword of one of the most famous pirates of all, Sir Francis Drake! I hope this blade won't cause ME any bad luck though, like it did with the previous captain who owned it.
text.t9=This woman has a serious problem. But I have got better things to do than to help her. Now what shall I do? Raid and plunder #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#? Or perhaps sink some pirate ships? There's plenty of other things to do in any case.
text.t10=The journal François Moulin gave me is a very interesting read, even though most of it can't be made out. I think the island mentioned might be #sisland_Cuba#. I should go there once and try to find that mysterious hidden item.
text.t11=I don't believe it! The hidden item was an ornate but surprisingly well preserved sword! I hope this blade won't cause ME any bad luck though, like it did with the previous captain who owned it.
