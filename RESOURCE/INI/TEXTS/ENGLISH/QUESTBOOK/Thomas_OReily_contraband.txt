title=Side Quest - Smuggling for #sThomas O'Reily#.
text.t1=A #sRedmond# merchant, on the island #sisland_Redmond#, named #sThomas O'Reily#, ordered me to deliver a contraband cargo to #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#, six hundred cwt of #ssmuggle_goods# and two hundred cwt of #ssmuggle_goods2#. First I should sail to a small bay north from this town where #sThomas#'s workers will load my ship. Then I should sail to #sFalaise de Fleur# and deliver the cargo to a fellow named #sAndre Juliao# in the tavern there.
text.t2=There is something wrong! #sThomas#'s workers tried to kill me. They said they wanted to teach me and #sThomas# a lesson. There was no cargo in the bay. I definitely need to find #sThomas# and find out what is going on.
text.t3=#sThomas# said that the cargo had been loaded aboard another ship, and that this ship sailed away recently. I asked him who attacked me and stole his cargo. He thinks it was the smugglers' guild. They took revenge on him because he stopped using their services. That's an unfortunate situation. In any case, I have to intercept the ship with #sThomas#'s cargo, board it, take the cargo, and deliver it to #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#.
text.t4=I successfully delivered the cargo to #sAndre Juliao#. That Portuguese fellow knows nothing about good manners, and besides, it appears that he suspects something about #sThomas#'s dealings with the smugglers' guild. I need to warn #sThomas# to be careful with #sAndre#.
text.t5=#sThomas# thanked me for the warning and gave me some money.
text.t6=#sThomas# said that those were the members of the smugglers' guild who attacked me and then stole his cargo. He asked me to intercept their ship and get the cargo back, but I had to refuse him because I don't want to get involved with organizations like the smugglers' guild.
text.t7=The workers on the beach were part of the smuggling guild and they weren't happy with #sThomas#. I've decided to side with them and let them handle this.
