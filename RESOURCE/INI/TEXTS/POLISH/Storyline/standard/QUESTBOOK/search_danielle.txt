title=Find #sDanielle#.
text.t1=Rheims mentioned that the legend that helped him find the treasures is at the church's library at #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. If I want to find #sDanielle# and find out what's going on, I need to go there.
text.t2=The Spanish priest named Padre Domingues refused me access to the library. But if I find some documents for him that were stolen by a person named Ferro Cerezo, he'll let me into the library. Cerezo is in #sConceicao# on #sisland_Conceicao# now.
text.t3=It appears that the stolen papers have information that compromise Padre Domingues.
text.t4=I managed to persuade Ferro that I need the papers that incriminate Domingues more than Ferro does. Now I can return to #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t5=I managed to buy the priest's papers, and now I can sail back to #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t6=Ferro refused to give me the papers, leaving me no other choice - I'll have to take them from him. As I understand it, his ship is lying at the port. I'll just have to capture it.
text.t7=I boarded Cerezo's ship without difficulty. Now I can return to Domingues.
text.t8=Ferro's ship is no ship at all - it's no more than a cockle-shell. I fired a couple of volleys, and it sank. But the papers have disappeared beneath the waves, and that should satisfy Domingues.
text.t9=I went to the library and pretty quickly found the book I need. It was on the table. Unfortunately - someone had torn some pages out of it - and I think that someone was #sDanielle#. All I know is that some clay tablets with some strange characters were found in the #sisland_Oxbay# mines. I suspect the original details of the legend were written on those tablets. I am sure that #sDanielle# is already on #sisland_Oxbay#. There's not a moment to lose.
text.t10=When I got out of the city, I was surrounded by some strange fellows. I don't know what they wanted from me. They attacked me, and I was forced to kill them.
text.t11=When I got out of the city I was surrounded by some strange fellows. They knocked me senseless and apparently sold me as a slave. I wonder where my companions are....
text.t12=A certain Leborio Drago confirmed that I have been sold as a slave to work in the mines. Fortunately my companions escaped. Now how am I going to get out of here?
text.t13=I talked to a soldier and told him I work for Silehard. It made an impression on him, and he called an officer. The officer was a good fellow, and now I am free. Moreover, that officer said that if I want to find those clay tablets, I can talk to Leborio Drago. He was the one appointed to look after the fellow who studied the tablets.
text.t14=I talked to a soldier and told him that I work for Silehard. It made an impression on him and he called an officer. The latter told me to give him some money in exchange for my freedom, but I didn't have enough to satisfy him.
text.t15=Leborio Drago found out that I am a captain, and he offered to help me escape with him. Of course I agreed. According to our plan, we need to get to the lighthouse where my ship will be waiting for us. Somehow Leborio managed to deliver a letter from me to my crew.
text.t16=We are free!!! From my conversation with Leborio, I learned that #sDanielle# visited the mines, and then left for #sisland_Isla Muelle# to find a person who studied the tablets.
text.t17=Leborio offered me a deal. I get him out of this foul place, and he tells me everything he knows about the clay tablets. Now I should sail to #sIsla Muelle# and try to find a person who made a copy of the tablets.
text.t18=I leaned a little on Leborio and he laid out everything he knows to me. It appears that #sDanielle# has already been here, but #spronoun# left for #sisland_Isla Muelle# in search of the person who made a copy of the tablets.
text.t19=Well, I decided to free Leborio, although it cost me dearly. Leborio doesn't know about it yet, but I plan to tell him. I can imagine how happy he'll be.
text.t20=They want 1000 gold for Leborio. I don't think he is worth that much.
text.t21=I am in #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle# now. I talked to the tavern-keeper, but I didn't get any useful information from him. Nonetheless, I know #sDanielle# is still somewhere here in the colony.
text.t22=As soon as I got out of the tavern, I saw #sDanielle#. I followed #spronoun2#. I lost sight of #spronoun2# for some time, and then I saw #spronoun2# again, lying on the ground with some scum with a dagger in his hand standing over #spronoun2# trying to kill #spronoun2#. Thanks be to God I got there in time!
text.t23=I talked to #sDanielle#, and everything is fine now. We joined hands, and together we plan to find the treasures and take revenge on Silehard for his treachery.
