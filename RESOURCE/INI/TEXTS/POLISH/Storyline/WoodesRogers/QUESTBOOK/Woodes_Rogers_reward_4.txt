title=Woodes Rogers fourth reward
text.t1=The next pistol (puh!) is in Roger's Mother's room above the Shop.
text.t2=Okay, I'm in the Shop now. Where am I supposed to use the padlock?
text.t3=Yes yes yes, it's a pistol of course. This one looks interesting though, provided with a very modern percussion lock. 'Eden N. Carolina', is it a family name, a plantation or a small town?
text.t4=Think I go back to the shop and search better for the gun this time.
text.t5=Now the question is which way to take to get back inside the maze of Rogers' rooms again?
