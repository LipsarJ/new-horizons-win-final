title=Woodes Rogers quest
text.t1=The Governor offered me a mission (and a fine reward): His daughter has been taken prisoner by Pirates "somewhere northeast of Guadeloupe". I have to consult an Archipelago Map!
text.t2=North of Guadeloupe - that would be Nevis with its Pirate Settlement! No time to waste.
text.t3=They have sold her to the Brothel!
text.t4=.
text.t5=I've found her! Met this lovely girl in the Brothel. She needs my help to escape.
text.t6=Promised to help the girl. This could be a new type of adventure. Her name is Caroline K.
text.t7=Somehow I'm still alive - and so is Caroline K! Now to Woodes Rogers in Port Royale and the waiting reward...
