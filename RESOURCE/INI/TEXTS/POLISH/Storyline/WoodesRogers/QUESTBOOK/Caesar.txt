title=Caesar
text.t1=A Negro. Member of Teach's crew. Was much liked and trusted by Teach.
text.t2=Hanged in Williamsburg 1719. Where in the Caribbean did he hide his map-piece?
text.t3=Teach placed a crewmember, a trusted negro, in the hold with a lighted match. Very likely to be Caesar.
text.t4=Lieutenant Maynard kept Teach's fourth sloop. He's living in Citadel Rock, Eleuthera. There may be a way from the Tavern to the Citadel.
text.t5=Maynard sold the sloop to a shipwreck dealer in Grand Turk port. He's office is in the old Fort. To the left when you exit the Town to the jungle.
text.t6=Explosives yes. Must be something useful in the Armory.
text.t7=I'll find the way to the shipwrecks via the Tavern kitchen and a bedroom upstairs.
text.t8=I'll need a workbench and tools to process this pile of dried Gunpowder.
text.t9=I have got Caesar's map, but again it's only a piece of a larger Caribbean Map.
text.t10=Caesar survived! That's why the numbers of the hanged pirates didn't match in the newspaper.
text.t11=There may something of value in the shipwreck traders bedroom.
text.t12=I have to return to Turks and the Sloop wreck. Caesar's map-piece may still be in the Gunpowder Storage.
text.t13=I have to find the Sloop wreck first. Caesar's map-piece may still be in the Gunpowder Storage.
