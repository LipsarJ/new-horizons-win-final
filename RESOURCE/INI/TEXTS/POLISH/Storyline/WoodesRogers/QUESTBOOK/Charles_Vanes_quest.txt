title=Charles Vane's quest
text.t1=I have 'volunteered' for another mission: Go to Port Royal and pick up the treasure the Pirates have demanded.
text.t2=The only thing the pirates want is a filled medicine chest!! 
text.t3=It's time to deliver these items to Charles Vane.
text.t4=The Medicine items are delivered. Charles Vane and his Captains have offered to teach me some new skills!
text.t5=Here we go again, another mission: Get the Charles Vane pirates some monks outfits, just like the Coastbrothers have! But first I have to get the prisoners out of here.
text.t6=Yes! I got outfits enough for a minor monastary. Hope Vane keeps his word about giving help...
text.t7=The red outfits are delivered. Now we have to find our way out of this place.
text.t8=Vane keeps an eye on all my five Pistols until I return!
text.t9=Father Bernard is willing to trade some Monk's outfits for gold. He also suggested that I go and play a tune in the Choir room... Okey?
text.t10=Charles Vane may be in the attic.
