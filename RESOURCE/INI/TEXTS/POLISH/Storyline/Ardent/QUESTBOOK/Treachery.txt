title=Treachery at #sRedmond#
text.t1=The French plan to invade #sRedmond# with the help of #svillain#. When the French arrive at the landward gate, #svillain#'s men will ambush the guards and open the gate to let the French force in. Perhaps the governor of #sRedmond# will pay a reward to know this.
text.t2=I failed to prevent the invasion and France has taken #sRedmond#. This is a bitter blow for the Grand Alliance. But perhaps it opens up new raiding possibilities for me.
text.t3=The invasion has happened - France has captured #sRedmond#. Tough luck on England, not that I care one way or another.
text.t4=Vive la France! The French have succeeded in their plan to capture #sRedmond#. One less base for our enemies, one more friendly port for me.
text.t5=#sgovernor# didn't believe my warning about the invasion. If I want to prevent #svillain#'s gang from letting the French into #sRedmond#, I'll need to watch for them appearing from #spronoun# house at night time.
text.t6=So much for a reward. I'm in prison again. Fortunately the English provide a better pillow than the Spanish. Unfortunately that means I can't use it to hit anyone over the head.
text.t7=Helping prevent the invasion of #sRedmond# paid off after all. I've received a full pardon from England.
text.t8=Helping prevent the invasion of #sRedmond# paid off after all. I've received a nice bag of gold from the governor.
text.t9=I wonder what the French intend to do next, now they have taken #sisland_Redmond#? Whatever their plan, there must be some way for me to get some gold out of it. Perhaps I can persuade, trick or simply ask the new governor of #sRedmond# to tell me.
