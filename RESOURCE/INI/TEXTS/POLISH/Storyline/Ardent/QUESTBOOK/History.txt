title=Historical Note
text.t1=Several warships would subsequently be named 'Ardent'. One, launched in 1764, was the first of a class of third-rate ships of the line; another ship of this class was 'HMS Indefatigable', which was converted to a 44 gun razee frigate. You will sail on this ship if you play the "Hornblower" storyline.
