title=Anaconda's Capture
text.t1=I was right to search for prize ships off #sisland_Isla Muelle#. I engaged a light galleon and after a hard fight, she was mine. There are some valuable goods in the cargo hold. Boca de Hubon is not a safe at the moment. I need to sell my cargo on #sisland_Redmond# and repair.
text.t2=Dash it! The Spaniards caught me before I reached the safe harbour at #sisland_Redmond#. Luck is with me, I escaped my captors in the #sSanto Domingo#'s Port and swam up to Boca de Yuman with Emilio. Now, I have to go to the village and find help.
text.t3=Finally, I met a fisherman in the village. He'll wait for me at Boca de Yuman. Afterwards, I just need to sail to Boca de Hubon and look for Eugene in the Buccaneer Camp. I'm sure he'll help me.
text.t4=That's done! I hired two experienced pirates introduced by Eugene. I hoped more but I think these men will be enough. Indeed, I have an idea to reach my ship. But for that, I need to go to the village church.
text.t5=Now, if we wear these robes, we can get into #sSanto Domingo# and its port, without having to fight. My galleon is moored waiting to be rescued.
text.t6=Yes! Finally I've got my ship back. Let's quickly clear the port and its guns. It will be best to sail to #sisland_Khael Roa#, a good hunting ground for enemy prize ships.
