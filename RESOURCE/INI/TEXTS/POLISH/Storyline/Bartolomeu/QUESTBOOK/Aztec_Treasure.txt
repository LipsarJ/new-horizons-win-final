title=The Aztec treasure
text.t1=I saw Morgan in the #sRedmond# townhall. He told me the Spanish has found a valuable Aztec treasure near Vera Cruz. He thinks the treasure could be guarded in the Vera Cruz fort. I agreed to help him seeing the last time our partnership was a success. (Hints: Before leaving the town, confirm you have enough food and gold for the mission. Afterwards, go to #sisland_Khael Roa# in order to be reloaded in Vera Cruz) 
text.t2=I didn't let my ship in the Vera Cruz Port. Because, if I've got some troubles, my ship won't be captured. Now, I should talk to the innkeeper.
text.t3=What a beautiful throne! It's made in precious stones. Now, I'm sure the treasure exists. Let's leave the fort before being detected.  
text.t4=We lost the Fleet during a tempest. Elting thinks she must make for Havana. Let's go to Cuba!
text.t5=I saw the Fleet entering the Havana port. I need to inform Morgan and the Governor. Next stop : #sRedmond#.
text.t6=Worried by the news, Morgan decided we should immediately go to Cuba. There, he will give me new instructions.
text.t7=A new task for me and Elting. We must know where the treasure is guarded and how many days it will stay in Cuba. Captain Damski could be our informer. Elting knows he lives in a house between the port gates and the Havana Church.
text.t8=We did it! We stole a fabulous treasure in one of the best Spanish forts. Thanks to this feat, we enter in the pirates' legend. No doubt, the Governor of #sRedmond# will congratulate us.
text.t9=This expedition was very lucrative. I've earned 150 000 gold coins and I'll earn much more when the throne is sold. Now, I'm going to Tortuga to rest as Morgan and Elting are thinking of doing too. Maybe in the future, I'll see Elting again.
text.t10=Damn it! I was detected by the soldiers. They raised the alarm and I've had to run away before the Spanish troops attack me. I don't know what happened to Elting. But, I'm sure I won't have any new opportunity for seeing the Aztec treasure!
