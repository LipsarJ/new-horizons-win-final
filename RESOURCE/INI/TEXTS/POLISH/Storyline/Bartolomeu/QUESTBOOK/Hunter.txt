title=The Hunter
text.t1=What does Governor Barreto want? It's a quick voyage going to #sisland_Conceicao# from #sisland_Oxbay#. I won't have to wait too much to know it.
text.t2=Now, I'm in the Luso-Spanish war. I need to find and kill the Spanish Captain Arturo Campos. According to Governor Barreto he's chasing around Tortuga and San Salvador with a galleon called San Pablo. 
text.t3=I didn't see Campos. I think he must be on the island because the ship was near White Reefs. Let's go there.
text.t4=Mission accomplished! Governor Barreto is revenged. Let's give him the good news.
text.t5=Confounded Spanish mercenaries! They kidnapped Emilio Soares. Leonardo Corrales, a spy in #sIsla Muelle#, is my unique way of finding them. He lives in a house looking onto a back yard, near the tavern.
text.t6=Too bad... The situation worsened. All my friends are in danger because of those mercenaries. The first one is Roxanne Lalliere herself : I must warm her. The last time, she said she wanted to work for the Governor of #sFalaise de Fleur#. Let's see him!
text.t7=Bad luck! She isn't in #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# but in mission in the English town of Alice on Eleuthera. I hope to see her there.
text.t8=The worse happened. Roxanne has been kidnapped, I'm quite sure, by the mercenaries. She must be in Puerto la Cruz. In order to enter the town, I disguised in Spanish officer and waited for the dark. I'm near the town, the conditions are perfect to try a rescue operation.
text.t9=I've had to climb the cliffs in order to avoid the guards along the road. However, I still have a hard task to accomplish. I need to find and kill the Captain of this fort. He must have the jail's keys in his uniform.
text.t10=I persuaded Johan Elting to join my crew. We discreetly went out the fort. Unfortunately, we met Padilla and his men short after in the jungle. They have been killed in a fight. Now, we can go to Alice town.
text.t11=Next stop, Havana. Emilio is jailed there. We'll land first at Bahia de San Antonio.
text.t12=After releasing Emilio, Elting killed Vice-Admiral Benavides. Let's go to #sRedmond# to decide our future.
text.t13=Roxanne returned to #sFalaise de Fleur# and Elting decided to start a new life in #sisland_Douwesen#. I'm motivated for new adventures. Why not going to Tortuga and look for some expeditions?
text.t14=Roxanne returned to #sFalaise de Fleur# but I'm motivated for new adventures. Why not look for any expeditions?
text.t15=After killing Johan Elting, we discreetly went out the fort. Unfortunately, we met Padilla and his men short after in the jungle. They have been killed in a fight. Now, we can go to Alice town.
