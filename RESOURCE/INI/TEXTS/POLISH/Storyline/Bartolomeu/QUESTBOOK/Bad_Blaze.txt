title=A famous pirate
text.t1=From now on, I work for the Portuguese Governor. My first task will be to go to #sisland_Oxbay# to find a lead on this Pirate. His ship had been damaged, he would need the assistance of a shipyard. I'll start my search at the #sOxbay# one.
text.t2=It seems he didn't go this way. Let's hope, I'll be luckier in the #sGreenford# shipyard.
text.t3=Found it! He repaired the ship in Bridgetown. I know his name now but not where he lives. However, he would have met François L'Ollonais and this French pirate lives on #sTortuga#. Let's go there and see if I can find him or someone who knows him.
text.t4=That was dangerous, but I've found some more clues. Charles worked for the pirate chief of #sisland_Turks#. I should meet this man and see if he knows where Charles is based.
text.t5=What bad luck! The pirate chief refused to help me. I need to think a bit, a rum at the tavern always helps. A lot of good ideas come over a drop of rum.
text.t6=Finally, I know where I can find Charles : at #sCharlestown#. I need to sail with the tide. Hopefully this Charles hasn't moved his base again.
text.t7=After some difficulties, I found Charles in his house. My plan for kidnapping him worked, even though I could have died under the cannonballs. Now, I just need to take Charles to the Pirate Settlement Port and then on to #sisland_Conceicao#.
text.t8=The reception at #sisland_Conceicao# was warm. The Governor was relieved by the Charles' arrest. He paid me and even gave me a beautiful sword. He also rewarded me with a cargo of goods. I should go to Boca de Hubon in order to sell the wares to Eugene Martin in the Buccaneer Camp.
text.t9=Son of a bush pig - Rivera! He stole my ship at Boca de Hubon when I was talking to Eugene. Fortunately, Eugene kindly offered to lend me a ketch, I should now find and capture a prize ship. Set sail to #sisland_Isla Muelle#, there are always some galleons off the island.
