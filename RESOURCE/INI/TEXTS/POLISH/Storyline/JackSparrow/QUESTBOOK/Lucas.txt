title=Find the missing son of the Spanish admiral.
text.t1=Admiral Da Saldanha has entrusted me with the task of finding his missing son, Lucas, for a reward of 10000 gold. He told me that he lost Lucas' track in #sFalaise de fleur# on #sisland_Falaise De Fleur#.
text.t2=The innkeeper Antoine Lebretton told me that Lucas has indeed been on #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# and indeed in #sFalaise de fleur#, but that he has recently sailed away somewhere. Lebretton also told me that Lucas had some relationship with Governor Le Moigne's daughter, Justine. Maybe she knows where Lucas has gone. Lebretton said that she often walks on the shore near the town.
text.t3=Well, I must admit that the boy has got some taste. Justine told me that Lucas has gone to see his father. I must get back to the admiral - maybe the boy is already there.
text.t4=It turns out that some bastards kidnapped Lucas when he was on his way from #sisland_Falaise De Fleur#, and are holding him for ransom. It's a pity the boy's got himself into such a mess, but this whole business is beginning to smell bad. So I refused to help the admiral to free his son - I prefer to be a few thousand coins poorer, but alive.
text.t5=It turns out that some bastards kidnapped Lucas when he was on his way from #sisland_Falaise De Fleur#, and they are holding him for ransom. I have agreed to help the admiral find his son, and now I must bring the kidnappers 20000 gold in exchange for Lucas. They will be waiting for me at the tavern in the smugglers lair on #sisland_Conceicao#.
text.t6=The dogs! These bastards killed the boy before I could do a thing! Why did I have to show off?! If I had just given them the ransom, Lucas would be alive.... What am I going to tell the admiral?
text.t7=I gave the ransom to the kidnappers, and got Lucas alive and well in return. I must hurry to get him to his father.
text.t8=I didn't give the ransom to the kidnappers. Instead, I cut them down like the dogs they were. Now I must get Lucas to his father.
text.t9=Lucas' father has generously thanked me for saving his son - 10000 coin are now jingling in my pockets.
text.t10=Lucas' father has generously thanked me for saving his son - a half of the ransom that I didn't give away is now mine. And this is no small sum - 20000 gold! Good deeds can, on occasion, be quite profitable.
text.t11=I have informed the governor of his son's death, and have returned the ransom. He was so cast down with grief I couldn't stand to look at him.
text.t12=The admiral was greatly upset by his son's death, of course, but I received my reward from him nonetheless, although I had to return the ransom. Oh, well. Ten thousand gold is not a petty sum.
text.t13=The poor old man was simply crushed by the sad news of his son's death. So crushed, in fact, that he didn't doubt my lies about giving the ransom to the kidnappers. This business has turned out to be quite profitable, and almost without any effort. I only had to slit a couple throats. If only I could always be so lucky.
text.t14=I couldn't deliver the ransom on time, and the kidnappers killed Lucas. I think I had better not show my face around any of the Spanish islands anytime soon. They won't ask questions...they'll just hang me.
text.t15=Lucas asked me if we could sail to #sFalaise De Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# to see Miss Justine Le Moigne again, I told him we could.
text.t16=Lucas asked me if we could sail to #sFalaise De Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise De Fleur# to see Miss Justine Le Moigne again, I told him he had to give the relationship up now he's an officer onboard my ship.
text.t17=Ran into a man by the name of Captain Maggee when making port in #sFalaise De Fleur#, he told me to go and see the governer, Sir Joseph Claude Le Moigne.
text.t18=Turns out that his daughter has disappeared, the same daughter that Lucas had a relationship with. I decided I would help find Le Moigne's daughter even if it is just to make Lucas happy. The governer also offered a good sum of money to get her back.
