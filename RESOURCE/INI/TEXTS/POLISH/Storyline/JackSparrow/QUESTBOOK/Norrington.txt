title=Meet Midshipman Norrington
text.t1=Met Midshipman Norrington. He really does dislike pirates!!
text.t2=Norrington is still on #sisland_Oxbay#, but he is putting his time to good use.
text.t3=Norrington is forming a militia to help with the invasion.
text.t4=Norrington is now a Captain - he still hates pirates - but we are off to #sisland_Turks# to try to stop a French attack.
text.t5=Norrington is returning home. He seems to like me in a weird sort of way. He left me a Tartane, but I need a bigger ship.
text.t6=Norrington, the Governor and Cutler Beckett wanted me to sail against the French. I didn't want to do that, so now I'm on my own.
