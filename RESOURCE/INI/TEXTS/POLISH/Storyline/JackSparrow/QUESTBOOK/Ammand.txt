title=Ammand the Corsair
text.t1=Father Bernard is the head of the church in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#. He asked me to find evidence to prove whether the priest named Father Jerald is guilty or not. He lives in the city of #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#, and people say that he is up to his eyes in sin, and that he forgot about God. This shouldn't take long. I'll run this errand in the hopes that I can win the trust of Father Bernard. I'll check at the tavern, first.
text.t2=Simon Hanpool is a tavern-keeper in #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#. I talked to him, and he had no idea that such rumors were circulating about Father Jerald. According to his words, Father Jerald is a good priest, and he tends to his duties without fail. Next, to talk to the priests.
text.t3=Father Jerald's assistant gave me the letters as evidence of the priest's guilt. I suspect he wants to take over Jerald's position. Has this ambition made him work with a Pirate Lord to get this position?
text.t4=Father Jerald claims that he is not guilty. And I find him very convincing. I think that something is wrong here. I need to talk to the woman involved.
text.t5=I made an offer to the priest to buy the letters and he agreed straight away. Doesn't it prove that he is guilty? I should return to Father Bernard on #sisland_Redmond# and tell him this before Ammand the Corsair can come and ask for some of the money.
text.t6=I made an offer to the priest to buy the letters and he agreed straight away. I don't know whether he is guilty or not, so I can tell Father Bernard whatever I choose. I should sail back to #sisland_Redmond# soon before Ammand the Corsair comes wanting the money
text.t7=The waitress confirmed that she really got several love-letters from Father Jerald. I'm not sure I trust her; she has a bit of the trollop in the way she acts. I'll talk to the tavern-keeper again.
text.t8=The owner of the tavern is still sure that Father Jerald is not guilty. He claims that the letters were written by another person named Yedam Kinne. He is Dutch, he lives here on this island, and he can forge anyone's handwriting. According to the tavern-keeper, he saw Kinne and the priest's assistant together several days ago. Perhaps some locals can tell me where to find this Dutchman.
text.t9=Yedam Kinne claims he had nothing to do with those letters. Is Father Jerald guilty?
text.t10=Yedam Kinne confessed that he wrote the letters. It means Father Jerald is innocent, and his assistant is the one who's caused all this trouble.
text.t11=I had to kill that stubborn Dutchman. Unfortunately, now there's no way of knowing whether he wrote those letters or not. Perhaps the tavern-keeper got some information from the waitress?
text.t12=The tavern-keeper told me that the girl who said that Father Jerald allegedly harassed her actually worked for Jerald's assistant. So, these letters are forgeries. Back now to #sisland_Redmond# with the proof.
text.t13=I returned to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# and managed to persuade Father Bernard that Father Jerald is innocent. He thanked me and asked to visit him later for my next task.
text.t14=I returned to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# and told Father Bernard that Father Jerald is guilty. He thanked me and asked to visit him later for my next task.
text.t15=On leaving the tavern I ran into a Pirate Lord by the name of Ammand the Corsair. Ammand told me that Father Jerald's assistant has a whole bunch of letters that proved Father Jerald's guilt, and that we could blackmail him into paying for the letters.
text.t16=Ammand the Corsair suggested I dress as a cleric and talk to the assitant first. Upon arriving outside the church, Ammand walked into the back room. Something strange is going on!
text.t17=On return to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#, Ammand the Corsair came up to me on the jetty asking for 50% of the money I received from blackmailing Father Jerald. I told him that I didn't blackmail him so there was no money. He got angry upon hearing this and told me the only thing he got was a gold statue from the whole thing and I would pay (guess that is what he was doing in the back room). I managed to knock him out for now, but I should leave quickly to see Father Bernard.
