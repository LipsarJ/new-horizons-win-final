title=The Brotherhood
text.t1=I met Sir Christopher Mings and I am going to become a member of the Brotherhood. He did say they were buccaneers, not pirates. 
text.t2=Sir Christopher has told me to meet a Sir Cutler Beckett in the Tavern and work for him till he gives me a job to meet a Tia Dalma on #sisland_Antigua#. Then I must bring back whatever I find there to Sir Christopher. 
text.t3=It seems I missed something on #sisland_Antigua# so I should go back there to see if I can find out what it was and bring it back.
text.t4=I have a part of the map to the Treasure of Cortez and an unusual compass. It's time to go back to Mings I think.
text.t5=So, it's #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# I need to look for Miss Brin's family. I know there is a pirate settlement there.
text.t6=So now I have the option, #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# or Gray Rock Bay. Well, the bay is nearer, but I did promise to help Annabella. Decisions, decisions.
text.t7=Now I'm working with the Excise! And she wants to go to #sTortuga# off the coast of #sisland_Hispaniola# under a pirate flag. I hope this doesn't get complicated.
text.t8=I've lost my ship! I have the diamonds though some of which I can use to buy a new one till I catch up with Shaypen again. Perhaps I should go to #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# after all, but maybe I need a new identity, in which case I should go back to #sOxbay# first. More decisions.
text.t9=We've found out that Brinkley is heading for a Dutch Island. Bootstrap Bill says to sail for #sWillemstad# on #sisland_Curacao#.
text.t10=So now I've killed an Excise Agent. That won't look good. I'd better see what I can find out about the Brin family in the pirate settlement.
text.t11=I have to escort Peter Willemoes to #sisland_Guadeloupe# to meet with Captain Petros.
text.t12=I finally have what I need for Sir Christopher so I need to go back to see him at #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay#.
text.t13=I already have a compass so I'm sure I don't need another one. I'll just go back to #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay# with what I have.
text.t14=Well we're here at #sPointe a Pitre# on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. I've let Mr. Gibbs go on to the Tavern. We can join him later, or maybe even now, I have a bit of a thirst.
text.t15=We need to sail to Anse Casse-Bois then find Captain Petros in the plantation there.
text.t16=Petros wants me to try to rescue one of the Brotherhood held prisoner on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. I'll go there and ask in the #sIsla Muelle# tavern. The people in there hear everything.
text.t17=This is madness. I can't just sit here. I think I should search the other bays on this island. You never know I might find something to help me.
text.t18=I met Barbossa when looking for the escaped pirate. He said I should sail to an island or a house. You can't sail to a house so an island it is.
text.t19=I have found Couch Captain Charles, now to return him to the Brotherhood at Petros' plantation on #sisland_Guadeloupe#.
text.t20=I have to find Nathan Kell, but only Anamaria knows where he is. So first I need to meet her at #sisland_Oxbay# lighthouse.
text.t21=Anamaria told me that Nathan Kell is somewhere in #sGreenford#. But I must be careful because while I am looking for Nathan Kell, Cutler Beckett is looking for me.
