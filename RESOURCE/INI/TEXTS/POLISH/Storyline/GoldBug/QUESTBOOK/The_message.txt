title=The message
text.t1=I have copied the full cipher text.
text.t2=Wonder if lieutenant G has any knowledge about secret code.
text.t3=' THE ' is most usual of all words; let us see, therefore, whether there are not repetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation.
text.t4=The letter which most frequently occurs in english is ' E '.
text.t5=Lieutenant G is in the North Tower.
text.t6=The Black Bird is obviously the new password.
text.t7=There's something hidden in RESOURCE\INI\TEXTS\ENGLISH\ Storyline\Goldbug\QUESTBOOK.
text.t8=I have not yet examined the book I found in Lieutenant G:s house.
text.t9=We're looking for the Gate to Mr Poe's house.
text.t10=I'll remember that '(' stands for the letter R.

text.t12=Dupin's office is situated near the exit to the Port.
text.t13=I'll remember that 'T' means D and ')' is S.
text.t14=At the very beginning of the text '5' has to be A.
text.t15=Dupin found out that '6' means I and '*' is N.
text.t16='1' is 'F' because it makes 'FROM' .
text.t17=':' is 'Y' because it makes 'FIFTY' for example. I should check the place 'SE.ENTH' too.
text.t18='0' is 'L', gives 'GLASS'.
text.t19='9' is 'M', the word 'MINUTES' is obvious.
text.t20='SE.ENTH' must be 'SEVENTH' so 'R' is 'V'.
text.t21='2' is 'B', the word 'BY' among others.
text.t22='.' is 'P', gives 'BISHOPS'.
text.t23='_' is 'C', can not be anything else 'BRANCH'.
text.t24=A good glass in the Bishop's hostel in the Devil's seat. Fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes. Northeast and by north. Main branch seventh limb east side. Shoot from the left eye of the death's head. A beeline from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.
