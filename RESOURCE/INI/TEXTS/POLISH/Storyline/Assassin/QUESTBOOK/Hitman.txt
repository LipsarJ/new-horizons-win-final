title=A worm in the apple
text.t1=I need to find Vassal Bethune, a pirate living in #sTortuga# near the island #sisland_Hispaniola# and working for Mateus Santos. Maybe, I could find some help in the tavern of that island. 
text.t2=I didn't have an opportunity to kill Santos. He offered me a job and I accepted it for now, my target is Ambroz Bricenos. Bricenos lives in #sSanto Domingo# on #sisland_Hispaniola# but he's usually at Boca de Yuman for his work.
text.t3=Ambroz Bricenos is dead. I must return to Santos for my reward. One never knows, do one?
text.t4=I've decided not to kill Santos. It's clear that the life of an assassin is not for me.
text.t5=Santos didn't let me down - I've been paid for killing Bricenos. And I must say, it's a tidy little sum, so I decided to do some more work for Santos till I can get close eough to kill him. My next target - merchant Geffrey Bampfylde. He lives in #sGreenford# on #sisland_oxbay#, to the left of tavern, across the street.
text.t6=What an ugly man that merchant was! It was a benefit to society to get rid of him. Now to go to Santos and get my money.
text.t7=I've decided not to kill Bampfylde, although his death might make the world a happier place. But I've made up my mind. It's clear that the life of an assassin is not for me.
text.t8=Yes! Santos paid me well! This Bampfylde must have made somebody really angry, I think, if they were willing to pay so much gold to get rid of him. I need to do another job for Santos. He said that I must kill a smuggler called Bertillon. He's often seen in the port of #sGrand Turk# on #sisland_Turks# island.
text.t9=Perhaps insolence is bred deep in a smuggler's blood, if this is so then Bertillon was the most insolent of all smugglers, however, this exceptional distinction did nothing to preserve his life. Santos should be well satisfied by my results.
text.t10=I decided not to kill Bertilion. Although he is a most insolent fellow, somehow I admire him for it. Perhaps I grow weary of this assassin's life.
text.t11=I must be doing well because Santos has sent me to dispatch his personal enemy, Amerigo Vieira. Vieira is rumored to be the best swordsman in the archipelago. Make that second best. Vieira's house is just to the right of the Governor's mansion in #sConceicao# on #sisland_Conceicao#.
text.t12=Those who do not follow the path of the sword will have a difficult time trying to understand the dying gratitude of Amerigo Vieira, for having died in a duel, and being killed by a fellow swordsman. I will have to devote some careful thought upon the information he gave me, regarding how he had also worked for Santos, and how Santos turned on him. Perhaps I have gotten myself into more trouble than I've realized.
text.t13=I decided not to kill Vieira. He said that he, too, worked for Santos for some time, and now Santos was trying to get rid of him because Santos had grown afraid of him. This has the ring of truth, so after this, I've little desire to meet with Santos again.
text.t14=I decided not to kill Vieira. He said that he, too, worked for Santos for some time, and now Santos was trying to get rid of him because Santos had grown afraid of him. This has the ring of truth, so after this, I've little desire to meet with Santos again, however, I must acquire my payment or risk arousing Santos' suspicions. Besides that, since Vieira's situation is pretty desperate, I was easily able to persuade him to work for me. Having the best swordsman in the archipelago as one of my officers won't hurt, especially if Santos doesn't find out.
text.t15=The payment I received for dealing with Amerigo Vieira sits strangely upon my conscience. In spite of this I have accepted another assignment from Santos; a messenger from Europe, an old Italian man hiding somewhere on #sisland_Guadeloupe#, brings news that must not be allowed to reach its final destination. Kind of gives a new meaning to the phrase, "dispatch a messenger".
text.t16=I found this man, Vito Leone. He tried to persuade me that Santos will soon try to eliminate me, but I'm not so foolish as to believe it. I'm doing my job well, and he's no reason to betray me. By the way, I mustn't forget to see Santos for my payment.
text.t17=Vito Leone, the 'messenger' whose death Santos so desires, turned out to be a rather important man. I've no wish to involve myself in the affairs of a guild of killers, so I'm retiring from the profession. Let them sort each other out as they wish.
text.t18=Vito Leone, the 'messenger' whose death Santos so desires, turned out to be a rather important man. And Santos turns out to be an ambitious impostor who kills anybody he perceives as presenting a threat to him. I've decided to help Leone to get rid of Santos and finally accomplish the mission the Vice-Admiral Benavides gave me. All I need to do is go to Santos' house in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# and kill him. Leone assures me that Santos will be there with a vastly reduced number of his bodyguards. Here's hoping that surprise is truly on my side.
text.t19=That's that, my life is no longer in danger. Leone paid me my fee, I released Camille and her lover. Now, I can come back to #sHavana# on #sisland_Cuba# and confirm to the Vice-Admiral, Mateus Santos is dead.
text.t20=I've decided not to kill Santos. It's clear that the life of an assassin is not for me.
text.t21=Three months have passed since Santos gave me the mission, and I still haven't found the target. I suppose there will be no more missions for me... but I've no strong regrets. There's not enough excitement, adventure or honor in a profession like that for a restless sea dog like me.
text.t22=Despite that I have found Vassal Bethune, I am not sure if he is leading me to Mateus Santos or into a trap. He told me that I should go near the #sRedmond# prison on the island #sisland_Redmond#.
