title=Side Quest - Church protection.
text.t1=Apperently sometimes being generous really helps. When I donated some money to the church, they told me they needed help. It seems lately some of their exorcists have met with bad luck so they are running out of holy crosses. It will take quite some time before a new shipment arives from the Vatican, so in the meantime they asked me to search the Caribbean to find one for them.
text.t2=Wow, helping the church really seems to help! After I delivered them a holy cross, they told me about some inventor from Italy who was ahead of his time. In the vaults of the Vatican they found some of his sketches and they were able to make this "telescope". They told me it was made for one of their best exorcists but he went away on a job before they could give it to him. Maybe if I find him, he can tell me how I can use this device. They say he was last seen in #sGreenford#.
text.t3=I found a weird book in a crypt. The book was on the body of an adventurer who seemed to have been better equipped than regular adventurers. He had a gun I've never seen before and he was carrying this book. I have no idea what it says. Maybe the people at the church know more about this book.
text.t4=The people at the church looked at the book for me and they told me it is full of exorcisms. I won't be able to use these, I'm afraid. But they also told me that the telescope I received was made for the gun which this adventurer was carrying. If I equip it, I should be able to take much better aim with my gun.
