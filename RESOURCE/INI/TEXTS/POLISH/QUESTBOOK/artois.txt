title=Side Quest - Artois Voysey.
text.t1=In #sQuebradas Costillas# on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# I saw two men fighting on the street. When I asked one of them what was going on, he attacked me. I think he was mad.
text.t2=The man I've saved is Artois Voysey, and, judging by his word, a good navigator. I made him a member of my crew. However, there is something strange about him. I should watch him carefully and keep him with me at all times.
text.t3=The man that I've saved is Artois Voysey, and, judging by his word, a good navigator. After I declined to add him to my crew, he said he will wait for me in pirate settlement on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# if I should change my mind.
text.t4=I think I saw Artois in #sConceicao# port on #sisland_Conceicao#. It looks like he was going to #sConceicao# town. Interesting. What is he up to?
text.t5=I learned that Artois was here in the tavern. He spoke with some Spanish fellow. Then three other people entered the tavern and confronted Artois and the wounded fellow Artois was speaking with. The wounded fellow is in the tavern upstairs now, so perhaps he knows where Artois has gone.
text.t6=Oh, dear. The first thing I saw when I came upstairs was the knife in the fellow's chest. I came too late... he was already dead.
text.t7=Considering how lucky I am, it is not surprising that when I came upstairs, soldiers came upon me, and accused me with the murder of this poor man. I was forced to kill them, because I have to find Artois. I don't think it will be easy for me to get out of town now. Maybe it would be better to make my way to the port? I'm not sure that Artois is somewhere here, but I doubt that he will live long.
text.t8=I decided to go with the soldiers. I hope that my innocence will be quickly proven.
text.t9=That's taken care of, thank heavens. They found witnesses that saw the murderer. I've been set free, and now I can leave the island, or try to find Artois. I suspect he is here somewhere.
text.t10=In the jungle near the town I saw strange people standing over Voysey's dead body.
text.t11=After I killed all the bandits, I've found that Artois was not dead. I asked him why he was kidnapped. And he told me about a ship whose cargo holds are filled with silver! The ship sank near #sisland_Douwesen#, so you can't reach it by sea, but there is a path through the waterfall. There's a promise of rich treasure in this affair.
text.t12=Artois didn't tell me what the bandits were searching for. I think I can guess - they were looking for a secret.
text.t13=My strained relations with the Portuguese authorities caused me a big headache, but somehow Artois took care of that through his connections - the Portuguese seem to have miraculously forgotten about my past misdeeds.
text.t14=Good heavens! In the next port, someone shot Artois. The attacker managed to escape, so there's nothing left for me to do but go to see my wounded friend.
text.t15=Spend 2000 gold to heal Artois, then wait two weeks while he recovers? No way, it's none of my business. Let him deal with this himself.
text.t16=I must spend 2000 gold to heal Artois,and then wait two weeks while he recovers. But at least I saved my man.
text.t17=After Artois recovered, he told me his story. He knows where to find a wrecked ship whose cargo holds are filled with silver. The ship sank near #sisland_Douwesen#, and you can't reach it by sea, but there is a path through the waterfall to the shore where it crashed. In return for telling me this story, Artois asked me to donate some gold to the Church. Well, I think that even after this donation, there should be plenty of treasure for me.
text.t18=Artois was telling the truth. I believe I can get about 50000 for this silver.
text.t19=I've kept my word, and have donated 4000 gold to Church in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#.
text.t20=I'm not such a fool as to throw gold away on the Church. Artois is not happy, but who cares?
text.t21=Artois is dead.
