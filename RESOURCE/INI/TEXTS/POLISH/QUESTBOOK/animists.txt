title=Side Quest - Strange things going on in the Caribbean.
text.t1=When I was on #sisland_Douwesen#, I found out that several children had been kidnapped last night. The women whose children were kidnapped tried to see the governor to ask him for help, but he wouldn't receive any visitors. Maybe I can speak to him.
text.t2=The governor of #sDouwesen# asked me to investigate and find the ones who've kidnapped the children. I refused. I don't want to get involved in this strange affair.
text.t3=The Governor of #sDouwesen# asked me to investigate the affair of the kidnapped children and promised to pay me well if I succeed. The only thing I know is that a captain of a merchant ship saw a mysterious ship in the morning, sailing away from the island's bay. The captain is in the tavern now, and I plan to begin my investigation by talking with him.
text.t4=I talked to the captain of the merchant ship and found out that he did indeed encounter a strange black ship with red sails, leaving #sisland_Douwesen#. Perhaps it was the pirates living in the jungle who kidnapped the children.
text.t5=I found out from the #sisland_Douwesen# pirates that they themselves suffered from that black warship that sank one of their ships. Now I have no doubt that the children are on that black ship. The pirates heard children crying, and the crying was coming from the ship. Next stop, #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#, to ask at the tavern. I hope this will be the last stop and I find those children.
text.t6=I was most fortunate to talk to the navigator of the ship attacked by the black ship. He said that the name of the pirate ship is 'Mefisto', and it was headed for #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# after it couldn't catch his ship. More pirates; lucky me.
text.t7=Alas, I am out of luck, all I managed to find out in the pirate's den is that the Mefisto really was here, and that the members of her crew even killed someone on the seashore. Perhaps I should ask one of the wharf rats; they may have seen the killing.
text.t8=#sFatherBernard# hired me to deliver a letter to Padre Domingues. At first sight, the mission seemed quite simple. However, one messenger has already been killed in the city by some people in red cassocks. I suspect that the fellows from that mysterious black ship have something to do with it.
text.t9=I came to #sisland_Isla Muelle#'s shore, just as #sFatherBernard# told me to. I was surprised to find some fellows waiting for me there.
text.t10=Some strange people proposed that I give them the letter to read in return for 1000 gold, saying that they will return the letter after reading it. I refused, so they drew their weapons.... Afterwards, on their dead bodies I found some strange medallions.
text.t11=Some strange people proposed that I give them the letter to read in return for 1000 gold, saying that they will return the letter after reading it. They returned the letter with the seal still on it, but it seems to me that it doesn't look like the original seal.
text.t12=Padre Domingues suspected that the letter was opened and then closed with another seal. I told him the truth. Thanks be to God it all ended well.
text.t13=Padre Domingues suspected that the letter was opened and then closed with another seal. But I insisted I was innocent. Then he said some things about God's redemption, or something like that. It doesn't matter. I don't like the priests, anyway.
text.t14=After I gave the letter to Padre Domingues, I got another mission. I'm to meet the barque 'Montanez' near #sisland_Oxbay# and guide her to #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t15=Oh, dear. When I arrived at #sisland_Oxbay#, the 'Montanez' was already sunk by some ships without any identification. I'll have to return to Padre Domingues empty-handed.
text.t16=I arrived just in time! When I reached #sisland_Oxbay#, the 'Montanez' was close to sinking, under attack by two ships without any identification. I've dealt with them.
text.t17=Surprisingly, 'Montanez' stopped briefly at #sisland_Oxbay#. From speaking with her captain, I learned that he had to deliver some passenger here. Now I think it's time to sail to #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t18=As I suspected, the padre is none too happy with the loss of this barque. Nonetheless, he didn't blame me.
text.t19='Montanez' is anchored near #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Padre Domingues seems to be very glad. It looks like something quite valuable is on this barque.
text.t20=My next mission is to deliver a letter to #sFatherBernard# on #sisland_Redmond#, and to watch out, because nobody but #sFatherBernard# should read this letter.
text.t21=They waited for me near the exit from the church. They looked just like those strange people on #sisland_Isla Muelle#'s shore. Not sure where they got the idea that I had to give them the letter, but foolishly they drew their weapons. How many more are there of these red-robed devils, and what is this cause they are so willing to die for?
text.t22=The letter is delivered now, and I received the reward I deserved. And now I know who is trying to stop me. #sFatherGareth#. Who could predict that? But now he has attacked me, in the church.
text.t23=My new mission is to find the Satanists' lair. The Church will give me a great reward, but more importantly, these Satanists have kidnapped children from #sDouwesen# on #sisland_Douwesen#, and I suspect they also are responsible for Padre Domingues' disappearance. I think I will start my investigation in the tavern in #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Maybe somebody there knows something about Padre Domingues' disappearance.
text.t24=Now I know the identity of the passenger of the 'Montanez'. It is a Maltese knight, Jaoquin de Masse, who arrived here to help us to defeat a Satanist band. He looks like an experienced warrior.
text.t25=After speaking with the innkeeper, I learned that a 'teacher' who calls himself an 'Animist', has arrived here. This 'teacher' has great influence upon the local youth, and, in particular, upon one Jordano, the son of the local cooper. And by a strange coincidence, Jordano's father has died under very suspicious circumstances. I should have a talk with this Jordano.
text.t26=I've found Jordano without any trouble. Seems to have a lot of influence over the local youths, and I suppose that makes sense, since he's a bit older. He told me that this 'teacher' has left #sIsla Muelle# for #sGreenford#, on #sisland_Oxbay# island. Off to #sGreenford#'s tavern again, to talk to that fountain of knowledge of things unusual - #sSimon# the tavernkeeper.
text.t27=I know that the man I am searching for is in #sGreenford#'s prison.
text.t28=The commandant of #sGreenford# prison wouldn't let me see the prisoner. It appears I have no choice but to sail for #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# to ask #sFatherBernard# to give me a letter, granting me access to the prisoner.
text.t29=A return to #sisland_Redmond# will take too long. I tried another plan. I intimidated the weak-willed fellow into giving me access to the prisoner. But I suspect this incident will cause my relationship with #snation# to suffer.
text.t30=I found another way to get to the prisoner. It was simple - I just paid 5000 gold, and all obstacles disappeared.
text.t31=At my insistence, the commandant let me in.
text.t32=The only sure way to find the Animist lair was to free the prisoner, so although reluctant I did it. Now it's back to #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle# with him and solve the mystery. I hope I can find those children before it's too late...
text.t33=#sFatherBernard# gave me a letter setting the #sGreenford# prisoner free, although he seemed amused by my request.
text.t34=I'm too intimidating for my own good! I decided to question the prisoner in the cell, but oops, he died. I hardly touched him! Before he died though, he said something about #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Maybe the Animist lair is somewhere near #Isla Muelle#? Perhaps on that little island to the south? I think we should be able to land there; I seem to remember seeing a sheltered cove.
text.t35=The 'teacher' believed that I was an Animist, and told me where to find the lair. His death was quick. And all that remains is to travel to the little island near #sisland_Isla Muelle# and see if I can find those children and Padre Domingues.
text.t36=All the Animists are dead, including their master. He was no easy opponent. But now I've got to get the children back to #sDouwesen#, and then tell #sFatherBernard# that Padre Domingues is all right and that our mission has been accomplished. Two rewards to be collected, but the biggest reward is getting those children safely back to their homes.
text.t37=With the destruction of the Animists band, my problems are solved. 'Mefisto', the warship with red sails, was waiting for me in the bay.
text.t38=The bartender at the #sGreenford# Tavern told me that since the warden is dead, I should just go into the prison and speak with the 'teacher'. I wonder how long he will keep his mouth shut about my role in the warden's death; I will need to be wary with the English in case he talks. 
text.t39=Talked with a wharf rat on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#; the kidnappers on the Mefisto are somehow tied in with #sFatherBernard# on #sisland_Redmond#.  I've been warned not to trust him, but I still need what information he might give.  Perhaps I should offer to help him with something so as to gain his trust in me, before I ask about the Mefisto.  Who knows?  Am I an optimist to hope there will be some money in it for me?
text.t40=The red-robed devils got Padre Domingues too. This is turning out to be some adventure. I still have this letter to deliver to #sFatherBernard#, so it's off to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# again.
text.t41=Domingues is back where he belongs; now to sail to #sDouwesen# on #sisland_Douwesen# and return my charges to their mothers and collect my reward from the Dutch governor. Then to #sFatherBernard# on #sisland_Redmond# to report and collect my reward from the church. The profit is fine, but definitely pale in comparison with the pleasure I will experience in returning these children safely to their homes.
text.t42=I have the children and Domingues onboard! I should sail back to mainland #sisland_Isla Muelle# to drop the priest back off at the church.
