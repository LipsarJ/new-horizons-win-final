title=Side Quest - The Quest for the Crystal Skull
text.t1=In #sSanto Domingo# I met a researcher named #sresearcher#. He wants me to find an amber crystal skull, currently in the possession of a tribe of Caribs somewhere on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. He promised a lot of gold if I bring him the skull.
text.t2=I found the Caribs on #sisland_Guadeloupe#, or rather they found me. They took one of my officers, #shostage#, as hostage. If I don't bring them the crystal skull, they'll kill #spronoun#. A Carib named #swarrior#, who knows where the skull is hidden, will accompany me.
text.t3=I found the Caribs on #sisland_Guadeloupe#, or rather they found me. They say their arrows were coated with a slow poison. If I bring them the skull within two months, they'll give me the antidote. Until then, I'm a dead #sperson# walking. A Carib named #swarrior#, who knows where the skull is hidden, will accompany me.
text.t4=We need to travel to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#, which the Caribs call 'Madinina'. We should land at the beach, not at the port, to avoid being attacked by the locals.
text.t5=After arriving at #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# beach, #swarrior# led me to a cave. Beyond that is a bridge which is old and dangerous. I should be careful to avoid falling through holes or weak spots. Hopefully #swarrior# knows how to cross safely.
text.t6=#swarrior# has found the amber skull! Now we can return to the ship, and then to #sisland_Guadeloupe#, which he calls 'Karoukera'. But first we need to cross that bridge again. And again I should watch where #swarrior# treads.
text.t7=I wonder where that mob came from? Their presence here can't be coincidence...
text.t8=In the cave, I was met by #senemy_captain#, who threatened to bring down the cave with a cannon if I didn't give him the skull. But he fired the cannon anyway. It didn't bring down the cave but it did bring down a large boulder blocking the exit. I can't move that boulder by myself...
text.t9=We were able to move the boulder out of the way. Now, quickly back to the ship! Perhaps we can take on #senemy_captain#'s ship and retake the crystal skull.
text.t10=I have the amber skull! Now I can return to #sisland_Guadeloupe#, find the Caribs, and get #shostage# back.
text.t11=I have the amber skull! Now I can return to #sisland_Guadeloupe#, find the Caribs, and get the antidote to this poison which is slowly killing me.
text.t12=As well as keeping his word, chief #schief# gave me a splendid tomahawk. I wonder what #sresearcher# will think of that?
text.t13=#sresearcher# gave me 20000 gold coins for the amber skull!
text.t14=#sresearcher# gave me 20000 gold coins for the amber skull! As for #shostage#, I can always find another officer in a tavern somewhere.
text.t15=When he learned of the poison, #sresearcher# decided to change the deal. Instead of gold, he gave me an antidote to the poison. I'm no richer but at least I'll live.
text.t16=Apparently #sresearcher# talked too much about the amber skull. Someone else took an interest and hired #senemy_captain# to get it. #sresearcher# doesn't want to tell me who that someone is, but says he'll make sure the culprit is thoroughly ruined. In a way, that's even better than running the miscreant through.
text.t17=I was able to kill all the Caribs, including their chief. I took the antidote from his body.
text.t18=I was able to kill all the Caribs, including their chief. I even managed to rescue #shostage#.
text.t19=I was able to kill all the Caribs, including their chief, but was unable to save #shostage#.
text.t20=I tried to attack the Caribs but they were too strong and I had to run away. They've probably killed #shostage#.
text.t21=I tried to attack the Caribs but they were too strong and I had to run away. I don't know if I'll find an antidote to their poison before it kills me.
