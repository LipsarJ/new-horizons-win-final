title=Side Quest - Rescue Peter Blood' crew
text.t1=I met famous English pirate Peter Blood in the #sGrand Cayman# tavern on #sisland_Cayman# island. Due to some excessive bad luck, he has lost both his ship and his crew. I agreed to bring him to #sisland_Cuba# and help him release his crew from the Spanish. In return, both he and his crew will join my own sailors. I can't sail into #sHavana# port with Peter onboard though. He might get recognized for being a fugitive pirate. Instead we'll make berth at one of the shores. Bahia de San Antonio would be a good place.
text.t2=The shore wasn't as safe as I thought. We were met by a patrol of Spanish soldiers when we landed there. I hope we will encounter no additional patrols on our way through the jungle. We must get to #sHavana# as soon as we can.
text.t3=Apparently the execution is just about to begin. We must get to the church immediately!
text.t4=Peter and I managed to release the crew. We'd better get back to the beach and leave this island though. And who is Emilio?
text.t5=We were met with a Spanish ambush on our way back to the ship. Fortunately they failed to kill us. We'd better go to the ship quickly and get away from this island.
text.t6=I wanted to have left #sisland_Cuba# by now, but apparently there's still one crewmember missing. Emilio Soares escaped shortly after Peter and most likely went to #sSantiago#. We should go there and find out if anybody has seen him. Emilio wanted to find a ship to leave the island, so there's probably a sailor in port who has seen him.
text.t7=We have found a good Samaritan at the port who has helped Emilio. He probably wouldn't have survived in #sSantiago# without this man. Emilio is currently out for a stroll outside the city. We are going to see if we can find him.
text.t8=The hardest part is finally over. We agreed to go to the #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# now to discuss my future partnership with Peter.
text.t9=On arrival at #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#, we were cornered by a bunch of mercenaries sent by the #sHavana# governor. We dealt with them quickly though. After that small delay, I accepted Peter and his crew, including Emilio, to join my own men. I think they can be of much use to me in the future.
text.t10=On arrival at #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#, we were cornered by a bunch of mercenaries sent by the #sHavana# governor. We dealt with them quickly though. After that small delay, I told Peter to go his own way. He is a good pirate, but I'm afraid that I'll keep encountering Spanish soldiers and mercenaries as long as he's with me.
text.t11=I met Peter Blood at the #sGrand Cayman# tavern on #sisland_Cayman# island. He needed my help to save his crew. I declined though. A rescue mission at #sHavana# on #susland_Cuba# seems too perilous to me.
