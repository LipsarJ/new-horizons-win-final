title=Side Quest - The Kapitein of #sDouwesen#
text.t1=I met a man named Willem Voigt with a bold plan to rob the governor of #sDouwesen#. Apparently he already has a record for this sort of thing because he was arrested.
text.t2=I met a man named Willem Voigt with a bold plan to rob the governor of #sDouwesen#. But he wasn't bold enough to follow me into the tunnel in #sPhilipsburg#.
text.t3=So I'm going to try it by myself. First I'll need a Dutch soldier's uniform. The best way to get one without bullet holes is probably to get the soldier drunk first. There are often soldiers trying to get drunk in taverns, so perhaps I can help one of them.
text.t4=That worked nicely. But this is a common soldier. If I'm to bluff my way into a governor's residence and start giving orders, I'll need an officer's uniform. The tailor in #sDouwesen# should be able to convert it.
text.t5=That tailor is no idiot. He'll put the appropriate insignia on the uniform if I can prove I'm entitled to wear them. I remember there's a forger in #sGreenford# who can probably provide the 'proof'.
text.t6=That tailor is no idiot. He'll put the appropriate insignia on the uniform if I can prove I'm entitled to wear them. I remember there's a forger in the buccaneer camp of #sisland_Hispaniola# who can probably provide the 'proof'.
text.t7=That tailor is no idiot. He'll put the appropriate insignia on the uniform if I can prove I'm entitled to wear them. Perhaps I can find someone who can provide suitable 'proof' in one of the outlaw camps.
text.t8=#sforger# should have finished my papers by now.
text.t9=I now have papers saying that I've been commissioned as a Kapitein in the Dutch army, specifically the regiment stationed in #sDouwesen#. That should satisfy the tailor there.
text.t10=The tailor accepted the papers and is ready to modify the uniform. I should return tomorrow.
text.t11=The tailor should have finished my uniform.
text.t12=A little expensive, but it's an investment. I now have a genuine uniform befitting a Kapitein in the local defence regiment. Now I need to find some soldiers on whom to test it. Guards on duty already have their orders, but perhaps I can commandeer an off-duty soldier from the tavern.
text.t13=There may be a forger in the buccaneer camp of #sisland_Hispaniola#.
text.t14=I'm committed to it now. My officers have left so as not to make the soldier suspicious. And I'd better not try to go anywhere other than straight to the town hall.
text.t15=They fell for it hook, line and sinker! I've left the soldier 'guarding' the town hall to prevent anyone from leaving. Time to get out of here before they realise they've been tricked! I probably don't want to go back into #sDouwesen# town hall again any time soon, in case the governor recognises me and has me arrested.
text.t16=Now that the ruse is over, my officers have returned. I should probably get out of the uniform soon to avoid being recognised.
text.t17=I should never have returned to #sDouwesen#. I've been arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
text.t18=I should never have returned to #sDouwesen#. The guards tried to arrest me and I had to fight my way out of there.
text.t19=The Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic found the whole thing very amusing and pardoned me. The governor of #sDouwesen# was less amused and warned me not to try anything like that again.
